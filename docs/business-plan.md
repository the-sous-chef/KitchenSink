# Business Plan: Commise
## AI-Powered Cooking Platform — From Fridge to Table

**Date**: June 6, 2026
**Status**: Draft — Pre-Implementation
**App Name**: Commise
**Company Name**: TBD (in progress)
**Monorepo**: KitchenSink (internal codename)
**Related**: [Competitive Analysis v2](./competitive-analysis-v2.md), [V1 Launch Plan](../specs/v1-launch-plan.md), [AI Enhancement Plan](./ai-enhancement-plan.md)

---

## 0. NAMING

### The Problem

- "KitchenSink" is the monorepo name, not the product. A different company ([trykitchensink.com](https://trykitchensink.com)) already has 13K downloads with that name.
- "Commise" is saturated: Commise® (commise.app), The Commise App, SousApp, Commise AI, plus generic AI "commise" positioning from Mise and others.
- **Chosen name: Commise** — distinctive, trademarkable, evokes "mise en place" (the French cooking term for having everything in its place before you start). "Com-" (together/complete) + "mise" (put in place). The act of preparing your kitchen to cook.

### Naming Criteria

| Criterion | Why |
|---|---|
| **Not "commise"** | Saturated. 5+ competitors use it. |
| **Not "kitchen"** | Overused (KitchenPal, KitchenSink competitor, Samsung Food/Whisk originally "Kitchen Stories") |
| **Made-up or whimsical** | Paprika-style. Arbitrary = stronger trademark. Zero search competition. |
| **Evokes cooking/food** | Subconsciously cooking-related without being literal |
| **Available .com + .app** | Both must be available or cheaply acquirable |
| ** pronounceable in English** | 2-3 syllables max |

### Naming Decision: Commise ✅

**Chosen**: **Commise** (com-MEESE)

| Criterion | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Evokes cooking** | "Mise en place" — the foundational cooking practice of having everything organized before you start |
| **Not "commise"** | ✅ Zero competitors use this name |
| **Not "kitchen"** | ✅ |
| **Made-up / distinctive** | ✅ Portmanteau — strong trademark protection |
| **Pronounceable** | ✅ 2 syllables: com-MEESE |
| **Search competition** | ✅ "Commcise" (2 m's) is a fintech/Euronext company in a completely different space. "Commise" (1 m) has no app store conflicts |
| **Domain availability** | TBD — check commise.com, commise.app, commise.ai, getcommise.com |

**Company name**: TBD — waiting on decision. Options: Commise Inc., Commise Labs, Commise Kitchen. Recommendation: keep it simple — **Commise Inc.** (or LLC).

**Brand positioning**: "Everything in its place" — Commise organizes your cooking life. Your recipes, your pantry, your meals, your grocery runs. All in one place.

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**What**: Commise — a full-stack AI cooking platform that knows what's in your fridge, generates validated recipes, plans your meals, builds smart grocery lists, and orders ingredients for delivery — all powered by the user's own AI key (zero inference cost).

**Why now**: $1.6B market growing 13.4% CAGR. No winner-take-all. ChatGPT + Instacart integration just launched (Dec 2025) creating a massive distribution channel. 30+ fragmented competitors but none combine pantry tracking + AI recipe generation + grocery ordering + cooking education in one app.

**How we win**: 
1. **Feature depth** (14 features vs competitors' 4-6)
2. **BYOK AI** (zero inference cost — every competitor pays per generation)
3. **ChatGPT Custom GPT** (200M+ weekly users as distribution channel)
4. **Instacart commission** (5% of every grocery cart ordered through the app)
5. **USDA-validated recipes** (quality moat — ChatGPT fails 12-36% of the time)

**Ask**: Solo founder, bootstrapped. Seeking to validate product-market fit before raising.

## 2. MARKET OPPORTUNITY

### Market Size

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Global AI recipe market | $1.6B (2025) | Research & Markets |
| CAGR | 13.4% | Research & Markets |
| US household food waste | $2,300/year avg | USDA |
| Total US food surplus | $380B/year | ReFED |
| ChatGPT weekly active users | 200M+ | OpenAI |
| Instacart monthly shoppers | 80M+ (via Chicory network) | Instacart |

### Why There's No Winner Yet

- **SideChef** — $7M raised, 6 features, no pantry
- **Jow** — 7M users, but no AI generation, no pantry, no depth
- **Samsung Food** — 500K MAU, but Samsung-dependent, no pantry, no AI gen
- **Clove AI** — 50K users, pantry + expiry, but no grocery ordering, no meal planning, iOS only
- **Kitchen Sink** (competitor) — 13K downloads, has Instacart, but no pantry, no nutrition, solo founder ceiling

**Nobody has pantry + AI + grocery + cooking mode + nutrition + community in one app. That's the gap Commise fills.**

### Target User

**Primary**: 25-45 year-old working professionals who cook 3-5 nights/week, are tired of "what's for dinner?", waste food regularly, and use ChatGPT or AI tools in their daily life.

**Secondary**: Home cooks who want to digitize family recipes, learn cooking skills, or eat healthier with less mental effort.

**NOT targeting**: Professional chefs, restaurants, or meal kit subscribers (different market).

## 3. PRODUCT STRATEGY

### 3.1 The 14-Feature Roadmap

Already specced in detail. Summary:

| Phase | Milestone | Features | What Ships |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Foundation** | M0-M1 | Auth, Recipes, USDA Data, Recipe Import | Core recipe management with validated ingredients |
| **Surfaces** | M2-M3 | Recipe Digitization, Cooking Mode, Grocery Lists | Photo-to-recipe, hands-free cooking, smart lists |
| **Beta Launch** | M4 | Meal Planning | → **Public Beta** |
| **AI Layer** | M5 | AI Integration, Nutrition Planning | BYOK AI recipes, macro/micro tracking |
| **Monetization** | M6 | Subscriptions | → **1.0 Launch** with paywall |
| **Community** | M7-M8 | Creator Profiles, Cooking School, Notifications | Network effects post-1.0 |

### 3.2 The Moat (What Competitors Can't Copy)

| Moat | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Pantry data** | Real inventory with expiry dates. Users invest time entering their kitchen. Switching cost = high. Commise's pantry is the deepest in market (expiry, quantities, partials). |
| **BYOK AI** | Zero inference cost. Competitors burn cash on every generated recipe. We're profitable at any scale. |
| **USDA validation** | Recipe quality scores backed by nutritional science. Trust compound over time. |
| **Custom GPT channel** | First cooking app in ChatGPT's GPT Store with pantry intelligence. Land grab. |
| **Creator flywheel** | Creator profiles + Cooking School = UGC that gets better with scale. |

### 3.3 What We're NOT Building (Anti-Scope)

| NOT doing | Why |
|---|---|
| Our own grocery delivery | We're not a logistics company. Use Instacart's API. |
| Meal kit shipping | Infrastructure-heavy, low-margin. Not our business. |
| Restaurant POS/integration | B2B market, different sales cycle. |
| Social network / feed | Kills early retention. Ship when 50K+ MAU. |
| Hardware / smart kitchen | Samsung owns this. Don't fight them. |
| Video content production | Tasty/Joshua Weissman territory. We organize, we don't produce. |

---

## 4. GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY

### 4.1 Phase 1: Beta Launch (Months 1-4)

**Goal**: Ship core features, validate product-market fit, reach 5,000 beta users.

| Channel | Tactic | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Product Hunt** | Launch on PH with "AI cooking app that knows your fridge" positioning | Free |
| **Reddit** | r/cooking, r/mealprep, r/eatcheapandhealthy, r/productivity — authentic posts about solving the "what's for dinner" problem | Free |
| **Indie Hackers** | Build in public. Share metrics. The Kitchen Sink (competitor) founder is on IH and got 13K downloads this way. Replicate. | Free |
| **App Store Optimization** | Keywords: "AI recipe generator", "pantry tracker", "meal planning", "grocery list" | Free |
| **Referral program** | "Invite a friend, both get 5 extra AI recipes" | Minimal |

**Success metrics (Month 4)**:
- 5,000 downloads
- 1,500 MAU (30% activation)
- 35% day-30 retention
- 4.5+ App Store rating

### 4.2 Phase 2: ChatGPT Distribution (Months 4-6)

**Goal**: Launch Custom GPT in ChatGPT's GPT Store. Turn ChatGPT's 200M+ users into a distribution channel.

**The Custom GPT**:
- Free to use (no paywall in ChatGPT)
- OAuth sign-in to the app (Feature 005 already specs this)
- Core loop: User describes what they want → GPT generates recipe → validates against pantry → creates smart grocery list → opens Instacart checkout
- Free tier: 10 recipes/month in ChatGPT. Upsell: "Download the app for unlimited recipes + pantry tracking + cooking mode"

**Why this works**: 
- Zero customer acquisition cost (ChatGPT hosts the GPT)
- Instacart commission starts flowing immediately (5% of every cart)
- App download upsell from every GPT user

**Success metrics (Month 6)**:
- 20,000 Custom GPT users
- 5,000 grocery orders via Instacart (25% conversion)
- $25,500 Instacart commission (5% × $85 avg cart × 6,000 orders) + CPA bonuses
- 2,000 app downloads from GPT upsell

### 4.3 Phase 3: Growth (Months 6-12)

**Goal**: Scale to 200K MAU, activate creator flywheel, explore funding.

| Channel | Tactic |
|---|---|
| **GPT Store optimization** | Reviews, featured placement, seasonal campaigns ("Thanksgiving planner") |
| **Content marketing** | Blog: "How AI Recipe Apps Actually Work", "Stop Throwing Away $2,300/Year in Food" |
| **Creator program** | Food bloggers get free Premium + verified profiles. They bring their audience. |
| **Partnerships** | CPG brand sponsorships in recipes (SideChef proved this at $200M basket value, 15x ROAS) |
| **Instacart cross-promotion** | Instacart features the app in their marketplace (they want partners who drive orders) |

### 4.4 Phase 4: Platform (Months 12-18)

**Goal**: Become the intelligence layer between any AI assistant and grocery delivery.

| Channel | Tactic |
|---|---|
| **MCP Server** | Launch KitchenSink MCP server for Claude, Gemini, and any MCP-compatible AI |
| **API platform** | Open API for recipe publishers, food bloggers, nutrition apps |
| **White label** | Grocery retailers can embed the AI recipe engine in their own apps |
| **International** | Expand beyond US (UK via Tesco/Sainsbury's API, EU via local partners) |

## 5. REVENUE MODEL

### 5.1 Three Revenue Streams

| Stream | Model | Month 6 | Month 12 | Month 18 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Instacart Commission** | 5% of cart value from grocery orders placed through the app/GPT | $8K/mo | $100K/mo | $300K/mo |
| **Subscriptions** | Freemium ($5.99/mo or $49.99/yr) — unlimited AI recipes, pantry tracking, nutrition, cooking mode | $600/mo | $12K/mo | $50K/mo |
| **Creator / CPG** | Sponsored recipes, verified creator profiles, brand partnerships | $0 | $5K/mo | $25K/mo |
| **TOTAL** | | **$8.6K/mo** | **$117K/mo** | **$375K/mo** |

### 5.2 Revenue Assumptions (Conservative)

| Metric | Month 6 | Month 12 | Month 18 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total users (app + GPT) | 25K | 250K | 750K |
| Monthly grocery orders | 1,500 | 20,000 | 60,000 |
| Average cart value | $85 | $85 | $85 |
| Instacart commission rate | 5% | 5% | 5% |
| Subscription conversion | 5% | 8% | 10% |
| ARPU (blended) | $0.34/mo | $0.47/mo | $0.50/mo |

### 5.3 Why Instacart Dominates (Not Subscriptions)

Traditional app wisdom says "subscriptions = revenue." In cooking apps, that's wrong.

- **RevenueCat data**: Food apps see 2-5% subscription conversion, 25% day-30 retention
- **SideChef proved**: $200M annual grocery basket value with CPG advertising. The money is in the grocery flow, not the subscription.
- **Instacart pays 5%**: A user who orders groceries twice/month at $85/order generates **$8.50/month in commission** — more than a $5.99/month subscription.
- **The subscription is the upsell**, not the primary revenue. Free users who use Instacart generate more revenue than paid subscribers who don't.

### 5.4 Unit Economics

| Cost | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **AI inference** | **$0** | BYOK model — users bring their own API key |
| **Hosting (AWS)** | ~$200-500/mo at 25K users | Fargate + RDS + S3 + CloudFront |
| **Instacart API** | Free (they pay you) | Developer Platform access is free |
| **Auth0** | Free tier (up to 25K MAU) | Then $35/mo |
| **App Store fees** | 15-30% of IAP | 15% via Small Business Program |
| **Customer acquisition** | ~$0 (organic + GPT) | Until Phase 3 paid marketing |
| **Gross margin** | **~90%+** | Near-zero variable cost per user |

## 6. COMPETITIVE DEFENSE

### 6.1 Competitive Positioning Map

```
                        DEPTH (features)
                        ↑
        Samsung Food    |   ★ KitchenSink (you)
        (500K MAU)      |   (14 features)
                        |
    Jow                 |
    (7M users)          |   Clove AI

                        |
    ────────────────────┼──────────────────→ SCALE (users)
                        |
    Kitchen Sink (comp) |   Mise (waitlist)
    (13K, has Instacart)|
                        |

        ($7M raised)    |
                        |
```

**You are in the top-right quadrant (depth) with a path to scale via Custom GPT. Nobody else is there.**

### 6.2 Defensive Moats (In Order of Strength)

1. **Pantry data lock-in** — Users invest hours cataloging their kitchen. Switching cost = data re-entry. Strongest moat.
2. **BYOK cost advantage** — Every competitor with hosted AI pays per generation. You don't. They can't price-match your free tier.
3. **Custom GPT first-mover** — If you're the first cooking GPT with pantry + Instacart, you own that slot in the GPT Store.
4. **USDA quality validation** — Technical moat. Competitors would need to integrate USDA food data + build confidence scoring. Months of work.
5. **Creator network effects** — Weak initially, strong at scale. More creators → more content → more users → more creators.

### 6.3 Kill Zone Analysis

| What could kill us | Probability | Defense |
|---|---|---|
| **ChatGPT adds pantry features** | Low — ChatGPT is a general tool, not a vertical app. They'd need persistent state, which breaks their architecture. | Be the Custom GPT they call. |
| **Instacart builds their own recipe app** | Medium — they already have recipe pages. But their core business is logistics, not content. | Be their highest-performing developer partner. Make it more valuable to keep you than compete. |
| **Jow adds pantry tracking** | Medium — they have 7M users but no AI gen. Adding pantry is a feature, not a re-architecture. | Ship before they do. Your pantry is deeper (expiry, quantities, partials). |
| **Samsung adds AI generation** | Medium — they have AI features in Food+ but not generation. | BYOK is structurally different. Samsung pays for inference. You don't. |
| **Apple/Google add cooking to OS** | Low — they'd do health/nutrition, not recipe creation. | Not worth worrying about. |

---

## 7. RISKS

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Name collision with trykitchensink.com~~ | ✅ RESOLVED | Product renamed to **Commise**. KitchenSink = monorepo only. |
| **Solo founder velocity** | 🟡 High | 14 features is a lot for one person. Prioritize ruthlessly. Beta with 6 features, add rest post-launch. |
| **Instacart changes commission terms** | 🟡 High | Don't depend solely on Instacart. Subscriptions + CPG + creator revenue as backup. |
| **ChatGPT changes Custom GPT API** | 🟡 High | Build a thin adapter layer. If GPT actions change, only the adapter needs updating. |
| **BYOK confusion** | 🟡 Medium | Non-technical users won't know what an API key is. Offer a hosted AI tier ($2.99/mo) for users who don't want BYOK. |
| **User acquisition too slow** | 🟡 Medium | Double down on GPT Store. If organic is slow, run targeted ads on cooking subreddits ($500/mo test budget). |
| **Recipe quality complaints** | 🟡 Medium | USDA validation + confidence scores visible to users. Never show a recipe below 80% confidence. |

---

## 9. FUNDING STRATEGY

### Option A: Bootstrap (Recommended for Months 1-6)

- **Cost to beta**: ~$2,000-5,000 (AWS infra + App Store fees + domains)
- **Cost to 1.0**: ~$5,000-10,000 (adds Custom GPT development + marketing)
- **Revenue at Month 6**: ~$8.6K/mo (mostly Instacart commission)
- **Break-even**: Month 4-5

**Why bootstrap first**: Prove product-market fit before giving away equity. The Instacart commission model means revenue starts flowing once grocery orders start. No need for VC to cover AI inference costs (BYOK).

### Option B: Seed Round (Month 6-12, if needed)

**Raise when**: Product-market fit validated, 50K+ MAU, clear path to $100K MRR.

| Use of Funds | % | Amount (example $500K raise) |
|---|---|---|
| Engineering (2 hires) | 50% | $250K |
| Marketing / growth | 25% | $125K |
| Operations / legal | 10% | $50K |
| Runway buffer | 15% | $75K |

**Valuation target**: $3-5M pre-money (typical for solo founder with traction at seed).

### Option C: Never Raise

If Instacart commission + subscriptions cover costs and generate profit, there's no need to raise. The BYOK model means near-zero variable costs. This can be a profitable solo business at $50K MRR.
