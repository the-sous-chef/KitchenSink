## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added — 5 new commands expanding the product lifecycle

- **`speckit.product-forge.sync-verify`** — Cross-cutting 7-layer artifact consistency checker:
  - Detects forward drift (earlier artifacts not reflected in later) and backward drift (later decisions that should update earlier)
  - Checks 7 layers: research↔product-spec, product-spec↔spec.md, spec↔plan, plan↔tasks, tasks↔code, spec↔code, cross-links
  - Each drift item: severity (CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO), direction, proposed resolution, human approval
  - `--quick` mode runs automatically between forge phase transitions (configurable via `auto_sync_between_phases`)
  - `--fix` mode applies approved resolutions after user confirmation
  - Outputs: `sync-report.md`, `sync-report.json`

- **`speckit.product-forge.pre-impl-review`** (Phase 5C) — Combined design, architecture, and risk gate:
  - Design Review: state completeness (empty/loading/error/partial/offline), UX pattern compliance, accessibility pre-check, component reuse
  - Architecture Review: structural checks, integration point validation, NFR coverage
  - Risk Assessment: technical/scope/integration/rollback risks with likelihood×impact matrix
  - Rollout strategy recommendation based on risk profile
  - Optional for features with ≤5 tasks and no UI
  - Outputs: `pre-impl-review.md`

- **`speckit.product-forge.code-review`** (Phase 6B) — Multi-agent code review:
  - 4 parallel review dimensions: Quality (SOLID, DRY), Security (OWASP surface scan), Patterns (vs codebase-analysis.md), Tests (coverage vs spec.md)
  - Enriched with Product Forge context — not a generic linter
  - Findings with CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW severity and suggested code fixes
  - Outputs: `code-review.md`

- **`speckit.product-forge.release-readiness`** (Phase 9) — Pre-ship checklist:
  - Feature flags & rollout: flag detection, rollout strategy, rollback plan
  - Documentation: user docs, API docs status, changelog, migration guide
  - Monitoring: metrics, alerts, dashboard panels, runbook
  - Analytics: tracking plan status, event instrumentation
  - Dependencies: environment readiness, infrastructure, security status
  - Consolidates api-docs, security-check, and tracking-plan status
  - Outputs: `release-readiness.md` with READY/CONDITIONAL/NOT READY verdict

- **`speckit.product-forge.change-request`** — Formal scope change management:
  - Captures change description, rationale, priority
  - Impact analysis: which artifacts affected, effort delta, risk assessment
  - Decision gate: Accept/Defer/Reject/Modify
  - Propagates approved changes with `<!-- CR-NNN -->` markers across all artifacts
  - Runs sync-verify after application
  - Deferred changes logged in `backlog.md`
  - Outputs: `change-log.md` (append-only)

### Changed — Lifecycle expansion and quality improvements

- **`forge.md`** (major rewrite) — Now orchestrates 13 phases + 2 cross-cutting commands (was 9 phases):
  - Phase Map expanded with Phase 5C (Pre-Impl Review), Phase 6B (Code Review), Phase 9 (Release Readiness)
  - Automatic quick sync-verify between every phase transition
  - Gate audit trail: every gate decision recorded in `.forge-status.yml` `gates:` array
  - Schema migration: auto-detects v1 `.forge-status.yml` and migrates to v2
  - Cross-cutting commands (sync-verify, change-request) surfaced in operating rules

- **`implement.md`** (enhanced) — Progressive verification during implementation:
  - Mini-verify checkpoint every N tasks (configurable via `progressive_verify_interval`)
  - Checks: task-code correspondence, spec AC alignment, unplanned changes, plan alignment
  - Results logged in `implementation-log.md`
  - CRITICAL drift pauses implementation with user options
  - Handoff now suggests code-review as next step

- **`status.md`** (enhanced) — Displays new phases, gate audit trail, sync history, change requests

- **`.forge-status.yml` schema v2:**
  - Added `schema_version: 2` for migration detection
  - Split `plan_tasks` into separate `plan` and `tasks` fields
  - Added phase fields: `pre_impl_review`, `code_review`, `release_readiness`, `retrospective`
  - Added `gates:` array for audit trail
  - Added `sync_runs:` section for sync-verify history
  - Added `change_requests:` array for CR tracking

- **`extension.yml`** — Version 1.3.0, 5 new command entries, 4 new tags

- **`config-template.yml`** — 3 new config keys:
  - `progressive_verify_interval` (default: 3) — tasks between progressive verify checkpoints
  - `auto_sync_between_phases` (default: true) — automatic quick sync at phase transitions
  - `release_readiness` (default: "optional") — required/optional/skip

- **`docs/file-structure.md`** — Updated directory layout, schema v2 documentation, new naming conventions (CR-NNN, DRIFT-NNN, D-NNN, A-NNN, R-NNN)

- **`README.md`** — Updated lifecycle diagram, 20-command table, file structure, installation version

---

## [1.2.1] — 2026-03-30

### Changed — Breaking: `implement` split into 3 independent commands

`speckit.product-forge.implement` previously covered Phase 5 (plan), Phase 5B (tasks), and Phase 6 (implementation) as a single monolithic command. It is now split into three **standalone, independently runnable commands**:

- **`speckit.product-forge.plan`** (new, Phase 5) — generates `plan.md` from `spec.md`, cross-validates against product-spec, exits after approval. Extension point before tasks.
- **`speckit.product-forge.tasks`** (new, Phase 5B) — generates `tasks.md` from `plan.md`, cross-validates all US-NNN and FR-NNN coverage, exits after approval. Extension point before implementation.
- **`speckit.product-forge.implement`** (narrowed, Phase 6) — executes implementation from `tasks.md` only, exits when all tasks are `[x]`. Extension point before verification.

**Why:** Community members can now insert custom steps between any of the three phases — architecture review, cost estimation, sprint planning, PR approval gates, external review workflows — without forking or patching the core commands.

**Forge orchestrator updated:** `forge.md` now delegates to `plan` → `tasks` → `implement` as three separate calls, with explicit extension point prompts between each.

**`.forge-status.yml` schema updated:** `plan_tasks` field replaced by separate `plan` and `tasks` fields.

**Migration:** If you call `speckit.product-forge.implement` directly and expect it to also run plan/tasks — update your workflow to call `plan` → `tasks` → `implement` in sequence.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-30

### Added

- **`speckit.product-forge.problem-discovery`** (Phase 0) — validate the problem before any research begins:
  - JTBD analysis (functional / emotional / social job layers)
  - Competing Forces model (Push + Pull vs Inertia + Anxiety)
  - Problem Statement Canvas saved to `problem-discovery/problem-statement.md`
  - User interview script with scoring rubric saved to `problem-discovery/interview-script.md`
  - Go / Investigate further / No-go decision with confidence score
  - Hypotheses H1–HN passed forward to Phase 1 research agents

- **`speckit.product-forge.api-docs`** — generate production-ready API documentation from `plan.md` contracts:
  - Auto-detects API framework (NestJS, Express, FastAPI, etc.) and existing OpenAPI setup
  - Generates OpenAPI 3.1 `openapi.yml` with full request/response schemas and examples
  - Generates `postman-collection.json` with auto-token-save login request
  - Consistency check: plan.md contracts vs actual implementation (reports drift)
  - Outputs: `api-docs/openapi.yml`, `api-docs/postman-collection.json`, `api-docs/consistency-report.md`

- **`speckit.product-forge.security-check`** — feature-scoped OWASP security audit:
  - Builds a threat model from `plan.md` — only checks surfaces present in this feature
  - Covers: A01 Broken Access Control, A02 Crypto Failures, A03 Injection, A04 Insecure Design, A05 Misconfiguration, A07 Auth Failures, A08 Integrity Failures
  - Scans for hardcoded secrets, missing ownership checks, mass assignment, missing rate limiting
  - Outputs prioritized findings (Critical / High / Medium / Low) with code evidence and fix patterns
  - Ship-readiness decision: ✅ Ready / ⚠️ Fix critical first / 🔴 Not ready

- **`speckit.product-forge.tracking-plan`** — analytics tracking plan from user journeys:
  - Auto-detects analytics SDK (Mixpanel, Amplitude, PostHog, Firebase, Segment)
  - Generates event taxonomy with property schemas, required/optional flags, and examples
  - Defines conversion funnels and abandonment funnels mapped to product-spec success metrics
  - Coverage matrix: each user story → key event → success metric
  - Generates ready-to-paste typed SDK snippets for the detected framework
  - Outputs: `tracking/tracking-plan.md`, `tracking/snippets.md`

- **`speckit.product-forge.retrospective`** — post-launch retrospective (run ≥14 days after ship):
  - Loads predicted KPIs from `research/metrics-roi.md` as the baseline
  - Queries NewRelic (via MCP) for real performance data since launch date
  - Compares predicted vs actual: adoption, completion rate, latency, error rate, business metrics
  - Research accuracy audit: were Phase 1 predictions correct?
  - Lessons learned, open issues table, and next-step recommendations
  - Closes the full lifecycle loop: Idea → Ship → Measure → Learn

### Changed

- `extension.yml`: description updated to reflect full 15-command lifecycle
- `extension.yml`: added tags `analytics`, `security`, `api-docs`, `jtbd`
- `README.md`: commands table expanded to 15 commands
- `README.md`: lifecycle diagram now includes Phase 0 (Problem Discovery) and post-implementation block (api-docs, security-check, tracking-plan, retrospective)
- `README.md`: file structure updated with `problem-discovery/`, `api-docs/`, `tracking/`, `security-check.md`, `retrospective.md`
- `README.md`: Why section updated to reflect the full 9-step value proposition

## [1.1.3] — 2026-03-28

### Changed

- `README.md` Installation section rewritten with proper `specify extension add/update` commands:
  - Install latest: `specify extension add product-forge --from .../archive/refs/heads/main.zip`
  - Install pinned version: `specify extension add product-forge --from .../archive/refs/tags/v1.1.3.zip`
  - Update: `specify extension update product-forge --from ...`
  - Added post-install config setup instructions with `specify extension path product-forge`

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-03-28

### Added

- **`playwright-cli` as execution engine for Phase 8B** (`speckit.product-forge.test-run`): agent now drives the browser interactively using `playwright-cli open`, `playwright-cli click/fill/snapshot/screenshot`, `playwright-cli tracing-start/stop`, and `playwright-cli -s=pf-auth state-save/load` for auth session reuse
- **Dual execution model** documented in `commands/test-plan.md`: `test-cases.md` (primary, agent-driven via `playwright-cli`) vs `.spec.ts` files (CI/CD companion, run with `npx playwright test`)
- **`test-cases.md` format specification**: each test case now uses a playwright-cli action table (`# | Action | playwright-cli equivalent`) so Phase 8B can translate steps mechanically without ambiguity
- **`playwright-cli` dependency section** in `README.md` Requirements with install instructions and link to [github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli)
- **"How to Run Tests"** section in generated `test-plan.md` now documents both execution paths: agent-driven (`/speckit.product-forge.test-run`) and CI/CD (`npx playwright test`)

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- Command names updated to required `speckit.{extension}.{command}` pattern (was `product-forge.*`)
- All 10 commands renamed: `speckit.product-forge.forge`, `speckit.product-forge.research`, etc.
- All internal cross-references in command files updated accordingly

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-28

### Added

- **`speckit.product-forge.test-plan`** — Phase 8A: Auto-detects test framework, ports, and env vars; generates smoke/E2E/API/regression test cases with `TC-*-NNN` IDs; writes runnable Playwright `.spec.ts` files with story traceability comments; initializes `bugs/README.md` dashboard
- **`speckit.product-forge.test-run`** — Phase 8B: Executes tests in priority order (smoke → E2E → API → regression); creates `bugs/BUG-NNN.md` per failed test with evidence, gap analysis, and fix log; auto-fix loop for P0/P1 bugs with single-test retest and smoke regression check; generates `test-report.md` with full coverage matrix and traceability chain
- **Adaptive research depth** in `speckit.product-forge.research`: input richness scoring (0–8 across 4 dimensions) selects FULL_INTERVIEW / PARTIAL_INTERVIEW / CONFIRM mode; avoids redundant questions when context is already rich

### Changed

- `speckit.product-forge.forge` orchestrator updated to 9-phase pipeline (8A and 8B added as optional after Phase 7)
- `forge.md` Phase Map table updated; Phase 8A/8B offer shown after every successful Phase 7 completion
- `extension.yml` version bumped to `1.1.0`; tags updated to include `testing`
- `docs/phases.md` updated with full Phase 8A and 8B documentation
- `docs/file-structure.md` updated with `testing/`, `bugs/`, and `test-report.md` in directory layout; `.forge-status.yml` schema updated with `test_plan`, `test_run`, and `testing:` block; `BUG-NNN.md` and `test-report.md` schemas added; naming conventions updated with TC-* and BUG-NNN IDs
- `README.md` updated with 9-phase lifecycle diagram, 10-command table, and expanded file structure

### Bug Fixes

- `forge.md` Phase 5 and 6 previously referenced SpecKit directly; corrected to delegate via `speckit.product-forge.implement` as intended

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-28

### Added

- **`speckit.product-forge.forge`** — Full lifecycle orchestrator with 7-phase pipeline and human-in-the-loop gates
- **`speckit.product-forge.research`** — Phase 1: Parallel research across competitors, UX/UI patterns, codebase analysis (mandatory), tech stack and metrics/ROI (optional)
- **`speckit.product-forge.product-spec`** — Phase 2: Interactive product spec creation with configurable detail levels (concise/standard/exhaustive) and auto-decomposition for large features
- **`speckit.product-forge.revalidate`** — Phase 3: Iterative review loop with structured change tracking in review.md; exits only on explicit user approval
- **`speckit.product-forge.bridge`** — Phase 4: Converts approved product-spec into SpecKit spec.md; supports Classic and V-Model SpecKit modes
- **`speckit.product-forge.implement`** — Phase 5-6: Wraps SpecKit plan + tasks + implement with product-spec cross-validation at each sub-phase
- **`speckit.product-forge.verify-full`** — Phase 7: Full traceability verification across 6 layers (code ↔ tasks ↔ plan ↔ spec ↔ product-spec ↔ research)
- **`speckit.product-forge.status`** — Status reporter showing all phases, artifact inventory, and next recommended action

### Feature File Structure

Introduced the `features/<name>/` directory convention with:
- `research/` — all research artifacts + README index
- `product-spec/` — all product spec artifacts + README index
- `.forge-status.yml` — phase tracker
- `review.md` — revalidation changelog
- `verify-report.md` — verification report

### Decomposition & Cross-linking

- Auto-detects large features and suggests file decomposition for user journeys and wireframes
- All documents cross-linked via feature root README.md and product-spec/README.md
- Token budget awareness with `max_tokens_per_doc` config setting

### Configuration

- `config-template.yml` with full project configuration options
- `.product-forge/config.yml` project-level config support
- Per-feature config override support
