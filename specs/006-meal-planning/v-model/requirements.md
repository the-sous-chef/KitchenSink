# V-Model Requirements Specification: Meal Planning

**Feature Branch**: `006-meal-planning`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/006-meal-planning/spec.md`

## Overview

The Meal Planning feature enables users to create structured meal plans over configurable date ranges, manually assign recipes to meal slots (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks), and view daily and weekly nutritional summaries. Premium users gain access to AI-powered meal suggestions, auto-generation of complete plans, and food waste optimization. This feature transforms the app from a recipe storage tool into a daily-use lifestyle tool, driving retention and demonstrating premium value.

## Assumptions

- Users have an existing recipe collection in their account (from feature 001) before creating a meal plan; the system does not need to handle the case where a user has zero recipes for manual assignment.
- Nutritional data is available for all ingredients in assigned recipes via the USDA food data integration (feature 003); partial data scenarios are handled by feature 003, not this feature.
- The subscription tier check (premium vs. free) is enforced by the 010-subscriptions service; this feature consumes the result of that check rather than implementing it.
- No assumptions specific to this spec beyond those in 001-commise-recipe-app.

## Dependencies

- **001-commise-recipe-app** (Required): Provides the Recipe entity and user recipe collection APIs.
- **002-user-auth** (Required): Provides authentication and user identity for all meal planning operations.
- **003-usda-food-data** (Required): Provides nutritional data used to compute meal plan summaries.
- **005-ai-integration** (Referenced): Provides AI provider configuration consumed by AI suggestion and auto-generation features.
- **007-grocery-lists** (Downstream): Consumes meal plan data to generate grocery lists.
- **009-nutrition-planning** (Downstream): Links to meal plans for nutrition compliance tracking.
- **010-subscriptions** (Referenced): Provides subscription tier information used to gate premium features.
