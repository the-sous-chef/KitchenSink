# System Design: Meal Planning

**Feature Branch**: `006-meal-planning`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/006-meal-planning/v-model/requirements.md`

## Overview

The Meal Planning system is decomposed into eight system components spanning meal plan lifecycle management, nutritional computation, AI-powered premium features, external service adapters, and cross-cutting infrastructure. The decomposition follows a layered architecture: a REST API layer handles client requests, a domain service layer enforces business rules, adapter components integrate external dependencies (Recipe API, USDA food data, Auth0, AI provider), and a persistence layer manages durable state. Cross-cutting concerns (type safety, documentation, accessibility) are addressed by a dedicated quality-assurance component.

## ID Schema

- **System Component**: `SYS-NNN` — sequential identifier for each component
- **Parent Requirements**: Comma-separated `REQ-NNN` list per component (many-to-many)
- Example: `SYS-003` with Parent Requirements `REQ-001, REQ-005` — component satisfies both requirements

| SYS-005 | Meal Plan Auto-Generator      | Generates a complete meal plan for premium users based on user-defined preferences and constraints. Produces a reviewable, modifiable plan by orchestrating the AI provider adapter and Recipe Assignment Service.             | REQ-007                                                                | Service   |
| SYS-006 | Food Waste Optimizer          | Analyzes ingredient overlap across assigned recipes within a plan and suggests rearrangements or swaps to maximize shared ingredient usage. Premium-only feature.                                                              | REQ-008                                                                | Service   |
| SYS-007 | External Integration Adapters | Encapsulates all outbound integrations: Recipe API (001), USDA food data (003), Auth0 authentication (002), AI provider (005). Exposes meal plan data for downstream consumers: grocery lists (007) and nutrition plans (009). | REQ-IF-001, REQ-IF-002, REQ-IF-003, REQ-IF-004, REQ-IF-005, REQ-IF-006 | Subsystem |
| SYS-008 | Quality & Compliance Layer    | Cross-cutting component enforcing TypeScript strict-mode compilation, JSDoc documentation coverage, accessible UI component contracts, and color-state accessibility rules across all modules.                                 | REQ-NF-001, REQ-NF-002, REQ-NF-003, REQ-NF-004                         | Utility   |
