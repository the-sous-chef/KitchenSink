## RQ-1: Competitor Analysis — Meal Planning UX

### Paprika

Paprika is the most feature-complete recipe-centric meal planner. Its architecture is a **three-tier calendar** (daily / weekly / monthly) with a separate **Menus** concept for reusable multi-day templates.

**Key UX patterns:**

- **Three views**: Daily (sorted by meal type), Weekly (7-day grid), Monthly (calendar overview). Users switch via segmented control.
- **Meal types**: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack — fully customizable with color and time associations.
- **Two entry points**: Add from the meal planner (+button) or from the recipe screen (Calendar toolbar button → pick date → pick meal type).
- **Drag-and-drop**: Windows version explicitly supports drag-and-drop to move meals between days; copy/paste via right-click also supported.
- **Menus (reusable templates)**: A "Menu" is a named collection of recipes organized by day (Day 1–7). Adding a Menu to the planner fills in all days from a chosen start date. This is the key differentiator for repeat-week planning.
- **Grocery list integration**: "Add to Grocery List" action works on the currently visible view scope (day/week/month). One tap generates the list for the entire visible period.
- **Calendar export**: Export to iCal/Calendar app — meals become calendar events.

**Data model insight**: Paprika's sync blog post reveals a web of relationships: recipes ↔ categories ↔ groceries ↔ meals must all sync simultaneously. This implies a normalized relational model, not embedded JSONB.

### Mealime

Mealime takes a **list-first, not calendar-first** approach. The core loop is: browse recipes → add to plan → build plan → get grocery list. There is no week-grid calendar view in the free tier.

**Key UX patterns:**

- **Plan-as-a-list**: A meal plan is a flat list of recipes for the week, not a day-by-day calendar grid. The "Schedule" feature (assign recipes to specific days) is a secondary step.
- **Preference-driven discovery**: Dietary type, allergies, disliked ingredients, and macro filters drive recipe surfacing. The app shows only recipes that match.
- **Build flow**: Browse → tap + on recipe card → tap "Build this Meal Plan" → review → confirm. The entire flow takes under 20 seconds.
- **Grocery list**: Auto-generated from the plan. Users can check off items they already have and add custom items.
- **Nutritional info**: Calories, macros, micros — **Pro only**. Free users see no nutrition data.
- **Meal plan history**: **Pro only**. Free users can only have one active plan.
- **No drag-and-drop**: Mealime does not support drag-and-drop recipe assignment.

**Weakness**: Mealime is more of a "recipe discovery + grocery list" app than a true meal planner. No week view, no multi-meal-per-day assignment, no calendar grid.

### Eat This Much

Eat This Much is the most **automation-first** meal planner. Its core value proposition is "put your diet on autopilot" — the algorithm generates a complete week of meals that hit calorie and macro targets.

**Key UX patterns:**

- **Auto-generation**: Input calorie target, macro ratios, dietary style, meal count, cooking time per meal → system generates a full day or week instantly.
- **Lock-and-regenerate**: Users can lock meals they want to keep and regenerate the rest. This is the primary interaction model, not manual drag-and-drop.
- **Per-day customization** (Premium): Each day of the week can have unique calorie/macro targets (e.g., higher carbs on workout days).
- **Pantry integration**: Add items you already own; the algorithm prioritizes using them up to reduce waste.
- **Weekly auto-delivery** (Premium): The system emails a new week's plan + grocery list automatically.
- **AI feedback loop**: Thumbs up/down on meal combinations trains the recommendation algorithm over time.
- **Adaptive macro engine**: After 10–14 days of consistent weight logging with ≥80% meal compliance, the system recalibrates macros automatically.

**Algorithm insight**: The generator uses a constraint-satisfaction approach — it must hit calorie targets, macro ratios, dietary restrictions, disliked ingredients, cooking time limits, and budget simultaneously. It is not LLM-based; it is a rule-based optimizer with ML-trained preference weights.

## RQ-2: Calendar-Based vs. List-Based Planning UX

### The Verdict: Calendar wins for recipe apps; list wins for diet apps

| Dimension              | Calendar (Paprika model)                       | List (Mealime model)                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Mental model**       | "What am I eating on Tuesday?"                 | "What am I cooking this week?"          |
| **Primary user**       | Home cook planning family meals                | Diet-focused user hitting macro targets |
| **Drag-and-drop**      | Natural — move Tuesday's dinner to Wednesday   | N/A — no day-level assignment           |
| **Nutritional view**   | Per-day column totals                          | Per-plan aggregate                      |
| **Grocery generation** | Scoped to visible period (day/week/month)      | Whole-plan at once                      |
| **Reuse**              | Menus (reusable week templates)                | Saved plans (history, Pro only)         |
| **Complexity**         | Higher — requires understanding of grid layout | Lower — linear browse-and-add flow      |

**Recommendation for Sous Chef**: Use a **weekly calendar grid** as the primary view (aligns with 001's recipe-centric identity and Paprika's proven model), with a **list/agenda fallback** for mobile. The calendar grid enables drag-and-drop, per-day nutritional summaries, and the grocery list scoping that 007 needs.

**shadcn/ui has a pre-built meal planner block** (updated March 17, 2026) with breakfast/lunch/dinner slots, calorie counts, and daily nutritional totals using TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS. This is a strong starting point.

## RQ-3: AI Meal Suggestion Patterns

### Pattern 1: Constraint-Satisfaction Generator (Eat This Much)

The algorithm takes hard constraints (calories, macros, dietary flags, disliked ingredients, cooking time, budget) and soft preferences (cuisine history, ratings) and solves for a valid meal assignment. This is **not LLM-based** — it is a rule engine with ML-trained weights. Suitable for nutrition-first users.

### Pattern 2: LLM Structured Output (emerging pattern, 2025–2026)

Using LangChain + Zod schemas to guarantee structured JSON output from an LLM. The LLM receives user goals, dietary restrictions, and available recipes, and returns a typed meal plan object. Achieves ~94% JSON parsing reliability at scale; 100% with `StructuredOutputParser`.

```typescript
// LangChain + Zod pattern for structured meal plan generation
const weeklyPlanSchema = z.object({
    days: z.array(
        z.object({
            date: z.string(),
            meals: z.object({
                breakfast: z.object({ recipeId: z.string(), title: z.string() }).optional(),
                lunch: z.object({ recipeId: z.string(), title: z.string() }).optional(),
                dinner: z.object({ recipeId: z.string(), title: z.string() }).optional(),
                snacks: z.array(z.object({ recipeId: z.string(), title: z.string() })).optional(),
            }),
        }),
    ),
});

const parser = StructuredOutputParser.fromZodSchema(weeklyPlanSchema);
```

### Pattern 3: Preference-Filtered Recommendation (Mealime)

Surface recipes that match dietary type + allergy restrictions + disliked ingredients. No LLM involved — pure database filtering with personalization weights. Fast, cheap, deterministic.

### Recommendation for Sous Chef

For the **AI meal suggestions** feature (spec User Story 1, acceptance scenario 2), use a **hybrid approach**:

1. **Primary path** (free tier): Preference-filtered recommendation from the user's own recipe collection — filter by dietary flags, cuisine, estimated cook time, and recently-used exclusion. No LLM cost.
2. **AI suggestion path** (premium): LLM call via 005-ai-integration with structured output (Zod schema). The prompt includes: user's dietary preferences, current week's assigned recipes (for variety), nutritional targets from 009 (if linked), and the user's recipe collection titles/IDs. The LLM returns recipe IDs to assign, not new recipe content.
3. **Auto-generate path** (premium): Full week generation — same LLM call but for all 7 days simultaneously.

**NestJS integration**: Use `nest-langchain` (npm, actively maintained as of Feb 2026) for injectable LangChain agents, or wire directly via `@langchain/openai` + `StructuredOutputParser`. The 005-ai-integration spec already defines the AI provider config — 006 should consume it as a NestJS module dependency.

## RQ-4: Drag-and-Drop Library Selection

### 2026 State of React DnD

| Library                             | Weekly Downloads | Status          | Bundle (core) | Verdict                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `react-beautiful-dnd`               | ~1.2M            | ❌ **Archived** | ~30KB         | Do not use — deprecated   |
| `@dnd-kit/core`                     | ~2.8M            | ✅ Active       | ~6KB          | **Recommended**           |
| `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` | ~180K            | ✅ Active       | ~3.5KB        | For Jira-scale complexity |

**`react-beautiful-dnd` is archived** as of 2025. Atlassian moved to Pragmatic DnD for their own products. The community standard in 2026 is `@dnd-kit`.

### Why `@dnd-kit` for Sous Chef

- **Multi-container drag**: Drag recipes between day columns and meal-type rows — exactly the meal planner grid pattern. Uses `closestCorners` collision detection for multi-container setups.
- **Modular**: Install only `@dnd-kit/core` + `@dnd-kit/sortable` + `@dnd-kit/utilities` (~15KB total).
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader announcements, keyboard sensor, pointer/touch sensors all built-in.
- **TypeScript-first**: Full type definitions.
- **Virtual list support**: If the recipe picker sidebar has many recipes, combine with `@tanstack/react-virtual`.

```bash
npm install @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/utilities
```

**Collision detection for meal planner grid**: Use `closestCorners` (best for multi-container kanban-style layouts). Each day-column + meal-type cell is a `useDroppable` target. Recipe cards in the sidebar and assigned meal slots are `useSortable` items.

## RQ-5: Week/Calendar View React Libraries

### Options Evaluated

| Library                        | Stars | DnD Support | TypeScript | Tailwind | Verdict                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `shadcn/ui` meal planner block | N/A   | No (static) | ✅         | ✅       | **Best starting point** — customize     |
| `ilamy-calendar`               | New   | ✅ dnd-kit  | ✅         | ✅       | Full calendar, RFC 5545 RRULE           |
| `calendarkit-pro`              | New   | ✅          | ✅         | ✅       | 5 views, resource scheduling            |
| `react-beauty-calendar`        | Low   | ✅ dnd-kit  | ✅         | ✅       | Google Calendar-inspired, v2.0 Feb 2026 |
| `FullCalendar`                 | High  | ✅          | ✅         | ❌       | Heavy, not Tailwind-native              |

### Recommendation

**Build a custom weekly grid on top of `shadcn/ui` + `@dnd-kit`**, using the [shadcn/ui meal planner block](https://www.shadcn.io/blocks/calendar-meal-planner) as the visual template. This approach:

1. Matches the existing project stack (shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4 per AGENTS.md).
2. Avoids a heavy calendar library dependency for what is fundamentally a 7-column grid.
3. Gives full control over the meal-type row structure (Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner / Snack rows per day column).
4. Integrates cleanly with `@dnd-kit` for drag-and-drop.

The weekly grid is a CSS Grid layout: 8 columns (time/meal-type label + 7 day columns) × N rows (one per meal type). Each cell is a `useDroppable` target. Recipe cards are `useDraggable` items.

For **mobile** (Expo/React Native per AGENTS.md), use a vertical list view (day-by-day accordion) rather than a 7-column grid — the grid does not translate to small screens.

## RQ-6: Meal Plan Data Model

### Canonical Three-Level Hierarchy

The industry-standard schema for meal planning apps (validated across SmartEat AI, PrepPal, and multiple Stack Overflow discussions) is a **three-level hierarchy**:

```
meal_plans (1 per user per date range)
  └── meal_plan_days (1 per calendar date)
        └── meal_plan_entries (1 per recipe assignment: date × meal_type × recipe)
```

### Proposed PostgreSQL Schema for 006

```sql
-- Level 1: The plan container
CREATE TABLE meal_plans (
    id              UUID        PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    owner_id        UUID        NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    title           TEXT        NOT NULL DEFAULT 'My Meal Plan',
    start_date      DATE        NOT NULL,
    end_date        DATE        NOT NULL,
    -- Link to 009 nutrition plan (optional)
    nutrition_plan_id UUID      REFERENCES nutrition_plans(id),
    status          TEXT        NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active'
                    CHECK (status IN ('active', 'archived', 'template')),
    created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    CONSTRAINT meal_plans_date_range CHECK (end_date >= start_date)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_meal_plans_owner_id ON meal_plans (owner_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_meal_plans_date_range ON meal_plans (owner_id, start_date, end_date);

-- Level 2: Individual meal slot assignments
-- No separate "days" table needed — the date is a column on entries
CREATE TABLE meal_plan_entries (
    id              UUID        PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    meal_plan_id    UUID        NOT NULL REFERENCES meal_plans(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    plan_date       DATE        NOT NULL,
    meal_type       TEXT        NOT NULL
                    CHECK (meal_type IN ('breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'snack')),
    recipe_id       UUID        NOT NULL REFERENCES recipes(id),
    servings        NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 1.0
                    CHECK (servings > 0),
    -- Display order within a meal_type slot on a given day
    sort_order      INTEGER     NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    -- Denormalized nutrition snapshot at time of assignment (avoids re-join on every render)
    nutrition_snapshot JSONB,   -- { calories, protein_g, carbs_g, fat_g }
    created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_meal_plan_entries_plan_id ON meal_plan_entries (meal_plan_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_meal_plan_entries_date ON meal_plan_entries (meal_plan_id, plan_date);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_meal_plan_entries_slot
    ON meal_plan_entries (meal_plan_id, plan_date, meal_type, recipe_id);

-- Level 3: Reusable week templates (Paprika "Menus" equivalent)
CREATE TABLE meal_plan_templates (
    id              UUID        PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    owner_id        UUID        NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    title           TEXT        NOT NULL,
    description     TEXT,
    duration_days   INTEGER     NOT NULL DEFAULT 7 CHECK (duration_days > 0),
    created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE meal_plan_template_entries (
    id              UUID        PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    template_id     UUID        NOT NULL REFERENCES meal_plan_templates(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    day_offset      INTEGER     NOT NULL CHECK (day_offset >= 0), -- 0 = Day 1, 6 = Day 7
    meal_type       TEXT        NOT NULL
                    CHECK (meal_type IN ('breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'snack')),
    recipe_id       UUID        NOT NULL REFERENCES recipes(id),
    servings        NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 1.0,
    sort_order      INTEGER     NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **No separate `meal_plan_days` table**: The `plan_date` column on `meal_plan_entries` is sufficient. A separate days table adds a join with no benefit for this access pattern.
2. **`nutrition_snapshot` JSONB**: Denormalized nutrition at assignment time. Avoids a 6-table join (entries → recipes → recipe_ingredients → ingredients → food_nutrients → nutrients) on every calendar render. Updated when the recipe's nutrition changes via a background job or trigger.
3. **`servings` column**: Allows scaling a recipe's nutrition contribution (e.g., assign 2 servings of a recipe that serves 4).
4. **Templates**: The `meal_plan_templates` + `meal_plan_template_entries` tables implement Paprika's "Menus" concept — reusable week patterns that can be stamped onto a date range.
5. **`status = 'template'`** on `meal_plans`: Alternatively, a plan can be marked as a template directly, avoiding the separate template tables for simple use cases.

## RQ-7: Nutritional Rollup Aggregation

### The Query Problem

A meal plan nutritional summary requires aggregating `calories`, `protein_g`, `carbs_g`, `fat_g` across all entries for a given day or week, scaled by `servings`. The naive approach (6-table join per render) is too slow.

### Strategy 1: Denormalized `nutrition_snapshot` (Recommended)

Store a `nutrition_snapshot JSONB` on each `meal_plan_entry` at assignment time. The daily/weekly rollup becomes a simple SUM over the entries table:

```sql
-- Daily nutritional totals for a meal plan
SELECT
    plan_date,
    SUM((nutrition_snapshot->>'calories')::NUMERIC * servings)    AS total_calories,
    SUM((nutrition_snapshot->>'protein_g')::NUMERIC * servings)   AS total_protein_g,
    SUM((nutrition_snapshot->>'carbs_g')::NUMERIC * servings)     AS total_carbs_g,
    SUM((nutrition_snapshot->>'fat_g')::NUMERIC * servings)       AS total_fat_g
FROM meal_plan_entries
WHERE meal_plan_id = $1
GROUP BY plan_date
ORDER BY plan_date;
```

This query hits only `meal_plan_entries` — no joins. With the `idx_meal_plan_entries_plan_id` index, this is a fast index scan + aggregate.

### Strategy 2: PostgreSQL `GROUPING SETS` for Multi-Level Rollup

For the nutrition summary panel (daily totals + weekly total in one query), use `GROUPING SETS`:

```sql
-- Daily totals + weekly grand total in one query
SELECT
    plan_date,
    meal_type,
    SUM((nutrition_snapshot->>'calories')::NUMERIC * servings) AS calories,
    SUM((nutrition_snapshot->>'protein_g')::NUMERIC * servings) AS protein_g
FROM meal_plan_entries
WHERE meal_plan_id = $1
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
    (plan_date, meal_type),  -- per meal slot
    (plan_date),             -- per day total
    ()                       -- weekly grand total
)
ORDER BY plan_date NULLS LAST, meal_type NULLS LAST;
```

`GROUPING SETS` avoids multiple round-trips and is supported on RDS PostgreSQL 16.

Source: [PostgreSQL GROUPING SETS in Practice](https://thelinuxcode.com/postgresql-grouping-sets-in-practice-clean-multi-level-aggregations-without-query-sprawl/)

### Strategy 3: Snapshot Staleness Handling

When a recipe's nutrition data changes (e.g., after a USDA ingredient update from 003), the `nutrition_snapshot` on existing `meal_plan_entries` becomes stale. Two options:

- **Lazy refresh**: On meal plan load, check `recipe.updated_at > entry.updated_at` and re-compute snapshots for stale entries. Simple, no background job needed.
- **SQS-triggered refresh**: When 003 updates a food item, enqueue affected recipe IDs to an SQS queue. A Lambda worker re-computes and updates `nutrition_snapshot` for all entries referencing those recipes. Consistent with the existing SQS pattern in 003.

**Recommendation**: Use lazy refresh for MVP (simpler), migrate to SQS-triggered refresh when 003 is live.

---

## RQ-8: Integration with 001 (Recipes) and 007 (Grocery Lists)

### Consuming Recipes from 001

`meal_plan_entries.recipe_id` is a foreign key to `recipes.id` (001's table). The meal planning service reads recipes via the existing `RecipesService` from 001. Key access patterns:

1. **Recipe picker sidebar**: Query `recipes WHERE owner_id = $userId AND deleted_at IS NULL` with optional FTS filter. Paginated. Uses 001's existing search infrastructure.
2. **Nutrition snapshot population**: On entry creation, call `RecipesService.getNutritionSummary(recipeId, servings)` to compute the snapshot. This method aggregates `recipe_ingredients → ingredients → food_nutrients` (003's data).
3. **Recipe detail on hover/tap**: Deep-link to the recipe detail view from 001 — no data duplication needed.

**Visibility constraint**: A meal plan entry can only reference recipes where `owner_id = meal_plan.owner_id` OR `visibility = 'public'`. This mirrors 001's access control model.

### Feeding into 007 (Grocery Lists)

The grocery list generation flow (007) consumes meal plan data as follows:

```
meal_plan_entries (for a date range)
  → JOIN recipes → recipe_ingredients → ingredients
  → aggregate by ingredient_id, SUM(quantity * servings)
  → normalize units (003's unit normalization)
  → output: grocery_list_items
```

**The 006→007 contract**: 007 needs a `GET /meal-plans/:id/ingredients?startDate=&endDate=` endpoint from 006 that returns aggregated ingredient quantities for a date range. This is the primary integration surface.

**Scoping**: Paprika's model of scoping grocery generation to the currently visible view (day/week/month) is the right UX. The API should accept `startDate` + `endDate` parameters so 007 can request any range.

---

## RQ-9: Integration with 003 (USDA Nutrition) and 009 (Nutrition Planning)

### 003 Integration (USDA Food Data)

Nutrition data flows into 006 via the path established in 003's research:

```
recipe_ingredients.ingredient_id
  → ingredients.fdc_id (USDA FoodData Central ID)
  → food_nutrients (cached in RDS from 003's Lambda enrichment pipeline)
  → SUM(nutrient_value * quantity_in_grams / 100) per recipe
  → scaled by meal_plan_entries.servings
  → stored in meal_plan_entries.nutrition_snapshot
```

The `nutrition_snapshot` JSONB stores the **macro summary** (calories, protein, carbs, fat) for fast calendar rendering. Full micronutrient detail (for 009's compliance analysis) is computed on-demand by joining through to `food_nutrients`.

**Partial nutrition flag**: `recipes.has_partial_nutrition` (from 001's schema) indicates that some ingredients lack USDA data. The meal plan UI should surface this as a warning on the nutritional summary (e.g., "⚠ Nutrition estimate — some ingredients missing data").

### 009 Integration (Nutrition Planning)

009's `nutrition_plans` table links to `meal_plans` for compliance analysis. The integration is:

1. **Link**: A `nutrition_plan` has an optional `meal_plan_id` FK. When linked, 009 computes compliance by comparing `meal_plan_entries` nutritional totals against the nutrition plan's daily targets.
2. **Display in 006**: The meal plan calendar can optionally show a compliance indicator per day (e.g., a colored bar: green = on target, yellow = ±10%, red = >20% off). This data comes from a 009 API call, not computed in 006.
3. **AI suggestion context**: When generating AI meal suggestions (RQ-3), if a nutrition plan is linked, pass the daily calorie/macro targets to the LLM prompt as constraints.

## Summary of Key Decisions

| Decision                         | Choice                                                                 | Rationale                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary UX pattern**           | Weekly calendar grid (7-column × meal-type rows)                       | Matches recipe-app identity; enables DnD; aligns with Paprika's proven model |
| **Mobile UX**                    | Day-by-day vertical list (accordion)                                   | 7-column grid unusable on small screens                                      |
| **Drag-and-drop library**        | `@dnd-kit/core` + `@dnd-kit/sortable`                                  | Community standard 2026; react-beautiful-dnd deprecated                      |
| **Calendar component**           | Custom grid on shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4                             | Matches existing stack; shadcn meal planner block as starting point          |
| **Data model**                   | `meal_plans` → `meal_plan_entries` (flat, no days table)               | Minimal joins; date is a column, not a FK                                    |
| **Nutrition rollup**             | Denormalized `nutrition_snapshot` JSONB + `GROUPING SETS` query        | Fast calendar render; no 6-table join per row                                |
| **AI suggestions**               | Hybrid: preference-filter (free) + LLM structured output (premium)     | Cost-effective; LLM only for premium users                                   |
| **LLM integration**              | LangChain `StructuredOutputParser` + Zod schema via 005-ai-integration | Guaranteed JSON validity; reuses existing AI provider config                 |
| **Reusable templates**           | `meal_plan_templates` + `meal_plan_template_entries` tables            | Paprika "Menus" equivalent; enables repeat-week planning                     |
| **007 integration surface**      | `GET /meal-plans/:id/ingredients?startDate=&endDate=`                  | Scoped ingredient aggregation for grocery list generation                    |
| **Nutrition snapshot staleness** | Lazy refresh for MVP; SQS-triggered for post-003 launch                | Simple first; consistent with 003's SQS pattern later                        |
