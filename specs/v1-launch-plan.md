# KitchenSink v1 Launch Plan

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Ratified**: 2026-05-12
**Authority**: Director of Product (Sisyphus, acting)
**Scope**: Features `001`–`014`
**Status**: Active — supersedes ad-hoc launch sequencing
**Related governance**: [`governance-rules.md`](./governance-rules.md), [`cross-feature-consistency-report.md`](./cross-feature-consistency-report.md)
**Live verify state**: [`verify-snapshot.md`](./verify-snapshot.md) (refreshed each verification wave)
**Executive packet**: [`executive/README.md`](./executive/README.md)

---

## 1. Purpose

This document is the canonical launch plan for v1 of KitchenSink. It defines:

1. The complete v1 scope (all 14 features).
2. The milestone ladder (`M0`–`M8`) with internal codenames, feature assignments, entry criteria, artifact remediation work, and exit criteria.
3. The two public-facing launch gates: **Sous Chef Beta** (end of `M4`) and **Sous Chef 1.0** (end of `M6`).
4. Parallelization rules between milestones.
5. Milestone-to-feature traceability so each feature's `review.md` can reference its milestone.

If anything in this document conflicts with a per-feature `review.md`, **this document wins** for sequencing decisions; the per-feature `review.md` wins for product-content decisions.

## 3. Milestone Ladder

Internal codename convention: `Milestone <Cool Name>` (Tolkien locations, west-to-east journey).

Each milestone has three required sections: **Entry**, **Artifact Remediation**, **Exit**. A milestone is not done until every Exit criterion is satisfied with linkable evidence.

### 3.1 `M0` — Milestone Shire

**Features**: `002` Auth0 User Auth
**Theme**: Foundational identity. Nothing else can be built without this.

**Entry**:

- This launch plan ratified (this document committed to `main`).
- All engineering tracks aware of milestone assignments.

**Artifact Remediation**:

- Burn down `002` `verify-report.md`: 6 critical / 2 warning → 0 / 0.
- Regenerate `002` V-Model artifacts; close 278 untested rows + 59 missing trace refs in `traceability-matrix.md`.
- Execute `002` V-Model test suite (`acceptance-plan.md`, `system-test.md`, `integration-test.md`, `unit-test.md`); attach executed evidence.

**Exit**:

- `002/verify-report.md` shows `0 CRITICAL, 0 WARNING`.
- `002/v-model/release-audit-report.md` is no longer blocked under [GR-001](./governance-rules.md#gr-001-release-readiness-gate).
- Auth0 Authorization Code + PKCE flow demonstrably works on web and mobile in `dev` and `staging`.

---

### 3.2 `M1` — Milestone Rivendell

**Features**: `001` core recipe app, `003` USDA food data, `004` recipe importing
**Theme**: Recipes and ingredients. The product without these is not the product.

**Entry**:

- `M0` Exit met.

**Artifact Remediation**:

- **`001`**:
    - Resolve the two architectural blockers called out in `specs/001-sous-chef-recipe-app/review.md`: API URL prefix collision (see [GR-002](./governance-rules.md#gr-002-api-url-prefix-standard)) and missing `shared/recipe-core` type library (see [GR-007](./governance-rules.md#gr-007-shared-type-library-ownership)).
    - Burn down `verify-report.md`: 5 critical / 2 warning → 0 / 0.
    - Close 337 untested + 178 missing trace refs.
- **`003`**: Burn down 1 critical / 2 warning → 0 / 0. Close 131 untested + 107 missing trace refs.
- **`004`**: Burn down 1 critical / 2 warning → 0 / 0. Close 93 untested + 43 missing trace refs.
- V-Model regen + test execution for all three.

**Exit**:

- `001`, `003`, `004` `verify-report.md` all show `0 CRITICAL, 0 WARNING`.
- All three release-audit reports unblocked.
- Demonstrable end-to-end against real data: create a recipe, attach an ingredient pulled from USDA, import a recipe from a URL.
- `shared/recipe-core` type library exists and is consumed by every downstream feature spec that references recipe entities.

---

### 3.3 `M2` — Milestone Moria

**Features**: `011` Recipe Digitization
**Theme**: OCR / photo-to-recipe. Runs **in parallel** with `M3`.

**Entry**:

- `M1` recipe data model frozen (so the OCR pipeline targets a stable schema).
- Engineering capacity confirmed for a parallel track. If capacity is unavailable, `M2` runs **after** `M3` instead.

**Artifact Remediation**:

- Generate `011/verify-report.md` (currently absent — only `sync-verify-report.md` exists).
- Burn down findings to `0 CRITICAL, 0 WARNING`.
- Close 128 untested + 117 missing trace refs in `011/v-model/traceability-matrix.md`.
- V-Model regen + test execution.
- Add a documented OCR-accuracy benchmark on a labeled corpus to test evidence; baseline accuracy floor must be set before promotion to Beta.

**Exit**:

- `011/verify-report.md` shows `0 CRITICAL, 0 WARNING`.
- `011/v-model/release-audit-report.md` unblocked.
- Photo-to-recipe demonstrably works on web and mobile against the labeled corpus at the documented accuracy floor.

---

### 3.4 `M3` — Milestone Rohan

**Features**: `008` Cooking Mode, `007` Grocery Lists
**Theme**: The two surfaces a user touches per recipe. Runs **in parallel** with `M2`.

**Entry**:

- V-Model regen + test execution for both.
- Confirm offline-mode contract per [GR-005](./governance-rules.md#gr-005-offline-and-sync-strategy) (`008` is the named owner).

**Exit**:

- Both `verify-report.md` files show `0 CRITICAL, 0 WARNING`.

**Features**: `014` Notification Service
**Theme**: Cross-cutting plumbing. Largest test-evidence gap in the package; the long pole.

**Entry**:

- `M7` Exit met.

## 4. Parallelization Rules

| Pair                 | Allowed in parallel?           | Reason                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `M0` ↔ anything      | No                             | Auth gates everything.                                          |
| `M1` ↔ anything else | No                             | Recipe data model must freeze before downstream surfaces lock.  |
| `M2` ↔ `M3`          | **Yes** (decision: 2026-05-12) | Independent surfaces; both depend only on `M1`.                 |
| `M3` ↔ `M4`          | No                             | Meal planning consumes both cooking and grocery surfaces.       |
| `M4` ↔ `M5`          | **No**                         | Beta must produce real signal before AI sizing is locked.       |
| `M5` ↔ `M6`          | No                             | Subscription gating depends on the AI/nutrition tiers it gates. |
| `M6` ↔ `M7`/`M8`     | No                             | 1.0 must be GA-stable before audience-side surfaces ship.       |
| `M7` ↔ `M8`          | **Yes**, capacity permitting   | Independent post-1.0 surfaces.                                  |

## 5. Public Launch Progression

1. **Sous Chef Beta** — limited launch at end of `M4`. Invite/waitlist gated. Includes features `001`–`004`, `006`, `007`, `008`, `011`. **Does not** include AI (`005`), nutrition (`009`), or paid tier (`010`).
2. **Sous Chef 1.0** — promotion at end of `M6`. Adds `005`, `009`, `010`. Public sign-up open.
3. **Post-1.0 v1 increments** — `M7` adds `012` + `013`; `M8` adds `014`. v1 is "complete" only when `M8` exits.

## 7. Per-Feature `review.md` Header

Every per-feature `review.md` MUST carry a "Milestone Assignment" section near the top with the following keys, sourced from §2 of this document:

```markdown
## Milestone Assignment

- **Milestone**: `M<n>` <Codename>
- **Public launch**: Beta | 1.0 | Post-1.0 (in v1)
- **Source of truth**: ../v1-launch-plan.md
- **Last updated**: <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

If sequencing changes, this document is updated first; per-feature `review.md` files follow.
