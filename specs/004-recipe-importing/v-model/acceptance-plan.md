# Acceptance Test Plan: Recipe Importing

**Feature Branch**: `004-recipe-importing`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/004-recipe-importing/v-model/requirements.md`

---

## Overview

This document defines the Acceptance Test Plan for the Recipe Importing feature. Acceptance tests verify that the system satisfies user-facing requirements from the perspective of a real user interacting with the product. Each test case maps directly to one or more requirements from `requirements.md` and is expressed as a BDD scenario (Given/When/Then) that a QA engineer or product owner can execute.

Coverage spans three import paths (web URL, Instagram, physical copy/OCR), attribution and visibility rules, deduplication, subscription gating, and accessibility constraints.

**Dependencies**: Feature 001 (Recipe entity model), Feature 002 (Auth0 authentication), Feature 010 (subscription visibility rules).

## ID Schema

| Identifier               | Pattern      | Meaning                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acceptance Test Case     | `AT-NNN-X`   | NNN = parent REQ number, X = letter suffix (A, B, C...) |
| Acceptance Test Scenario | `ATS-NNN-X#` | Nested under parent AT; # = numeric suffix (1, 2, 3...) |

**Example**: `ATS-001-A2` = Scenario 2 of Test Case A verifying REQ-001.

## Exit Criteria

The Recipe Importing feature is accepted when all of the following conditions are met:

1. **All P1 acceptance test scenarios pass.** Every `ATS-*` scenario mapped to a P1 requirement executes without failure in the target environment.

2. **No open P1 defects.** Zero unresolved defects that block, break, or misrepresent any P1 requirement. P2 defects may remain open if documented and accepted by the product owner.

3. **Attribution is present on all web and Instagram imports.** Manual spot-check of at least three imported recipes (two web, one Instagram) confirms source URL, author, and platform are displayed on the recipe detail screen.

4. **Deduplication is verified.** Importing the same URL twice results in no new recipe record and the existing recipe is surfaced with a clone option.

5. **Physical copy imports are private.** At least one physical copy import is verified to be private and free of attribution data after save.

6. **Accessibility gate passes.** Playwright accessibility queries confirm all interactive import UI elements have accessible names. No state is conveyed by color alone (verified by inspection).

7. **Unauthenticated access is blocked.** Direct API and UI attempts to import without authentication are rejected and redirect to the auth flow.

8. **Paywalled source list is enforced.** At least one URL from the known paywalled source list is rejected at the import step with a user-facing explanation.

9. **Premium gating is correct.** A standard user cannot make any imported public recipe private. A premium user can make a substantively edited clone private.

10. **Product owner sign-off.** The product owner or designated representative has reviewed the acceptance test results and approved the feature for release.
