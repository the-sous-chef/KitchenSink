## Orphan & Gap Report

### Orphan Analysis

**Orphan ATs** (acceptance tests with no corresponding REQ):

> None identified. All AT cases in `acceptance-plan.md` map to a REQ-\* identifier via the naming convention (AT-NNN-X → REQ-NNN, AT-IF004-A → REQ-IF-004, AT-NF004-A → REQ-NF-004, AT-NF005-A → REQ-NF-005).

**Orphan UTPs** (unit test cases with no corresponding MOD):

> None identified. All UTP cases in `unit-test.md` map to a MOD-NNN identifier per the ARCH↔MOD↔UTP traceability table.

**Orphan REQs** (requirements with no verification path):

> None identified. All 28 requirements have at least one verification method (Test, Inspection, or Analysis).

### Gap Analysis

**Requirements with no executable acceptance test (Inspection/Analysis only)**:

These requirements are verified by code review, static analysis, measurement, or architectural analysis — not by executable test scenarios. They are **not gaps** but are flagged for completeness:

| REQ-ID     | Verification Method | Risk Level | Mitigation                                                                                                                             |

| REQ-NF-003 | Analysis            | Medium     | Extraction accuracy measured against a curated test corpus of 100+ recipe URLs; threshold ≥85% enforced before feature flag enabled    |
| REQ-IF-001 | Inspection          | Low        | oEmbed integration verifiable by code review of `InstagramOEmbedAdapter`; endpoint URL pinned in config                                |
| REQ-IF-002 | Inspection          | Low        | Textract integration verifiable by code review of `OcrPipelineService`; AWS SDK version pinned in `package.json`                       |

| REQ-CN-002 | Inspection          | High       | Paywall blocklist + OCR private-default enforced in `AttributionVisibilityService`; verifiable by code review and UTP-009-A, UTP-011-A |
| REQ-CN-003 | Inspection          | Low        | Scope constraint enforced by `InstagramOEmbedAdapter` rejecting non-caption posts; verifiable by UTP-006-A2                            |
| REQ-CN-004 | Inspection          | High       | Legal review gate documented in spec (FR-014a); implementation blocked until legal sign-off; tracked as open action item               |
| REQ-015    | Analysis            | Low        | Preservation behaviour verifiable by architectural review of persistence layer; no executable AT defined at launch                     |

**Integration test gaps** (module boundaries with no integration test yet defined):

All 15 integration points in Matrix C are flagged ⬜ Pending Execution. The following are highest priority for integration test authoring before feature flag enablement:

| Priority | Integration Point                                       | Risk   | Reason                                                                                                                  |
