## Competitive Landscape Overview

For recipe importing, users care less about social discovery and more about **speed-to-success**: can they move a recipe from somewhere else into their own library with minimal cleanup, clear attribution, and no data loss. The four requested comparators cluster into two groups:

- **Power import managers**: Paprika, Mealie, Tandoor
- **Planner-led manager with manual emphasis**: Plan To Eat

## Competitor Profiles

### 1. Paprika

| Attribute                        | Detail                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Import strength**              | Mature URL import with broad site compatibility and in-app browser clipping |
| **Manual paste support**         | Present but not optimized for strict source policy controls                 |
| **Duplicate handling**           | User-mediated; limited canonical source de-dup guidance                     |
| **Attribution visibility**       | Source retained, but UI emphasis varies by platform                         |
| **Error recovery UX**            | Good parser fallback, limited structured remediation guidance               |
| **Gap opportunity vs Commise** | Better legal-state communication and deterministic duplicate-to-clone flow  |

### 2. Mealie

| Attribute                        | Detail                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Import strength**              | URL scraping for self-hosted users; community plugins improve coverage   |
| **Manual paste support**         | Typically markdown/text driven; quality depends on user formatting       |
| **Duplicate handling**           | Inconsistent across deployments; mostly user-managed                     |
| **Attribution visibility**       | Available, but not always prominent in default UI                        |
| **Error recovery UX**            | Technical; expects advanced user troubleshooting                         |
| **Gap opportunity vs Commise** | Consumer-grade parse-and-confirm and explicit paywall/legal error states |

### 3. Tandoor

| Attribute                        | Detail                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Import strength**              | Strong recipe scraping and hosted/self-host options                              |
| **Manual paste support**         | Supported; parser quality improves with templates                                |
| **Duplicate handling**           | Usually append-or-create behavior without canonical clone-first UX               |
| **Attribution visibility**       | Source field exists; variable prominence in recipe detail                        |
| **Error recovery UX**            | Better than many OSS peers, still form-heavy for non-technical users             |
| **Gap opportunity vs Commise** | Guided duplicate resolution tied directly to clone workflow (`FR-008`, `FR-011`) |

---

### 4. Plan To Eat

| Attribute                        | Detail                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Import strength**              | Reliable browser capture and planning integration                            |
| **Manual paste support**         | Strong manual entry/paste for planner-centric users                          |
| **Duplicate handling**           | Primarily user sorting/curation after capture                                |
| **Attribution visibility**       | Source retained but secondary to planning workflow                           |
| **Error recovery UX**            | Practical but not deeply diagnostic                                          |
| **Gap opportunity vs Commise** | Better parser transparency and explicit legal/attribution policy enforcement |

## Strategic Differentiation for 004

1. **Duplicate-to-clone first UX**: canonical source detection routes users to clone instead of producing fragmented duplicates.
2. **Attribution as product invariant**: attribution is visible and locked, not an optional metadata field.
3. **Policy-aware error handling**: paywall/legal constraints are user-visible and structured.
4. **Recovery-first parsing**: parse-and-confirm plus explicit corrective paths for malformed sources.

---

## Risks to Monitor

- Instagram API policy changes may narrow extraction fidelity.
- Competitors with browser extension ecosystems can close parsing-coverage gaps quickly.
- If legal policy is unresolved (`FR-014a`), differentiation claims around compliance are weakened.
