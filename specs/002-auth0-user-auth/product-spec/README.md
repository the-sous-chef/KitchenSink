| Artifact      | File                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Spec  | [product-spec.md](./product-spec.md)  | Vision, personas, epics, MoSCoW story map with FR traceability, and out-of-scope list. The single source of truth for what is and is not in v1.                                                                                                                   |
| User Journeys | [user-journey.md](./user-journey.md)  | End-to-end flows for three personas (New User, Returning User, Support/Admin Operator) covering P1/P2/P3 stories plus cross-persona edge cases (session expiry, async deletion retry, suspension denial). Includes Mermaid sequence diagrams and coverage matrix. |
| Wireframes    | [wireframes/](./wireframes/README.md) | ASCII conceptual wireframes for five key UI screens: login, signup, MFA challenge, session expired, and mobile auth callback handling. Each wireframe annotates the FRs it satisfies.                                                                             |
| Metrics       | [metrics.md](./metrics.md)            | Per-story measurable outcomes for Must Have stories. Distinguish from `research/metrics-roi.md` which covers portfolio-level ROI; this file covers story-level product-team signals.                                                                              |

## Scope Boundary Reminder

Out-of-scope items inherited from `spec.md` remain unchanged:

- Email change flow (Auth0-managed; separate feature)
- Admin dashboard for user management

Any additional capability ideas discovered during synthesis are documented as WARNING items in [../verify-report.md](../verify-report.md), not promoted to requirements.
