# Acceptance Test Plan: Auth0 User Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `002-auth0-user-auth`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/002-auth0-user-auth/v-model/requirements.md`, `specs/002-auth0-user-auth/v-model/system-test.md`

---

## Overview

This plan maps BDD acceptance scenarios to every REQ-\* requirement in `requirements.md`. Each scenario is written from the end-user or operator perspective (not the component perspective — that is covered by the system test plan). Acceptance tests confirm that the feature satisfies its stated requirements as a whole, across both the web (Next.js) and mobile (Expo) platforms.

System tests (STP/STS) verify architectural behavior at the component boundary. Acceptance tests (AT/ATS) verify observable outcomes from the user's point of view. Where a system test already covers a behavior mechanically, the acceptance test confirms the same behavior through the product surface (UI, API response, or audit log).

Coverage: all 44 functional requirements (REQ-001 through REQ-044), 17 non-functional requirements (REQ-NF-001 through REQ-NF-017), 10 interface requirements (REQ-IF-001 through REQ-IF-010), and 7 constraint requirements (REQ-CN-001 through REQ-CN-007).

## ID Schema

| Identifier               | Pattern      | Meaning                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acceptance Test Case     | `AT-NNN-X`   | NNN matches the parent REQ number; X is a letter suffix (A, B, C...) for multiple cases per requirement |
| Acceptance Test Scenario | `ATS-NNN-X#` | Nested under the parent AT; # is a numeric suffix (1, 2, 3...) for multiple scenarios per case          |

**Example**: `ATS-001-A1` is Scenario 1 of Test Case A verifying REQ-001.

Non-functional, interface, and constraint requirements use the full ID prefix in the case identifier:

| Identifier               | Pattern       | Example       |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| Non-functional test case | `AT-NF-NNN-X` | `AT-NF-001-A` |
| Interface test case      | `AT-IF-NNN-X` | `AT-IF-001-A` |
| Constraint test case     | `AT-CN-NNN-X` | `AT-CN-001-A` |

## Exit Criteria

The feature is considered shippable when all of the following conditions are met:

### Functional Completeness

- All 44 functional acceptance test cases (AT-001 through AT-044) have been executed and passed.
- Zero P1 or P2 acceptance test cases are failing or blocked.
- P3 test cases (REQ-029, REQ-030, REQ-031) may be deferred to a follow-up release with explicit sign-off from the product owner.

### Non-Functional Completeness

- REQ-NF-007: `turbo run typecheck`, `turbo run lint`, and `turbo run format:check` all pass with zero errors in CI.
- REQ-NF-004: All auth UI screens pass Playwright accessibility queries (`getByRole`/`getByLabel`) with no `data-testid` usage.
- REQ-NF-012: Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs confirmed in CloudWatch for at least one successful execution of each auth flow.
- REQ-NF-013: Sentry integration confirmed by triggering a test exception and verifying the issue appears in the Sentry dashboard.
- REQ-NF-014: CloudWatch custom metrics confirmed present for login, signup, token refresh, account deletion, and reconciliation flows.

### Security Gates

- REQ-CN-002: Inspection confirms no password data exists in any Sous Chef component.
- REQ-CN-003: Inspection confirms Auth0 `sub` is not used as a primary identifier in the database or application logic.
- REQ-006: Token storage security confirmed on both platforms (httpOnly cookies on web; Keychain/Keystore on mobile).
- REQ-028: Inspection confirms no password data passes through Sous Chef API traffic.

### Regression

- No existing passing tests in the repository have been broken by this feature's changes.
- `turbo run test` passes with zero failures across all workspaces.

### Documentation and Traceability

- All test files include a block comment mapping requirement IDs to test case descriptions (REQ-NF-008).
- This acceptance plan is up to date and all AT/ATS IDs are traceable to a REQ in `requirements.md`.

### Deployment Readiness

- Infrastructure defined in CDK v2 deploys successfully to the staging environment.
- Auth0 tenant configuration (post-registration Action, social connections, PKCE settings) is applied and verified in staging.
- Reconciliation job or endpoint is deployed and has executed at least one successful run in staging.
