## Summary

| Layer                       | Status          | Findings                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| code ↔ tasks                | ⚠️ EXPECTED-GAP | `CODE_TASKS_COVERAGE = 0/58` verifiable tasks; all tasks are unchecked and no implementation files for planned creator-profiles modules are present yet         |
| tasks ↔ plan                | ✅ PASS         | `tasks.md` phases (1–7) align with `plan.md` phase decomposition and acceptance gate                                                                            |
| plan ↔ spec.md              | ⚠️ WARNING      | `plan.md` implementation scope follows detailed FR set from product-spec/V-model, while `spec.md` currently contains only six high-level FRs (`FR-001..FR-006`) |
| spec.md ↔ product-spec/     | ⚠️ WARNING      | `product-spec/product-spec.md` expands to 30 FRs and 11 user stories; alignment is directional but not 1:1 against current `spec.md`                            |
| product-spec/ ↔ research/   | ✅ PASS         | personas, problem framing, embed/profile/follow/analytics goals, and monetization delegation to 010 are consistent across both artifacts                        |
| v-model ↔ spec/product-spec | ❌ CRITICAL     | V-model traceability mappings are complete, but release audit remains blocked by `89` untested mapped scenarios and no ingested execution results               |

**Overall**: ❌ **BLOCKED**. Planning artifacts are internally coherent and traceability mapping gaps have been resolved. The verification gate cannot pass because V-Model scenarios remain unexecuted and no real test results have been ingested.

---

## CRITICAL Findings

### C-001: V-model execution evidence is in blocked state

- **Where**:
    - `specs/012-creator-profiles/v-model/release-audit-report.md`
    - `specs/012-creator-profiles/v-model/traceability-matrix.md`
- **Evidence**:
    - Release audit status is `❌ BLOCKED` with **0 missing traceability mapping cell(s)** and **89 mapped scenario references with no ingested execution results**.
    - Traceability rows are mapped, but scenario status remains `⬜ Untested` until real CI/manual execution results are ingested.
- **Impact**: Full-chain verification cannot be approved; requirements-to-test-to-result closure is incomplete.
- **Required action**:
    1. Execute mapped acceptance/system/integration/unit/hazard scenarios.
    2. Ingest real test execution results into traceability artifacts.
    3. Regenerate release audit with non-blocked compliance status.

## WARNING Findings

### W-001: `spec.md` is high-level while implementation planning is detailed against product-spec/V-model IDs

- **Where**:
    - `specs/012-creator-profiles/spec.md`
    - `specs/012-creator-profiles/plan.md`
    - `specs/012-creator-profiles/tasks.md`
- **Evidence**:
    - `spec.md` defines six high-level FRs (`FR-001..FR-006`).
    - `plan.md`/`tasks.md` reference detailed FR identifiers (for example `FR-013`, `FR-028`, `FR-029`) derived from `product-spec/product-spec.md` and V-model requirements.
- **Why not CRITICAL**: This is consistent with retroactive-bootstrap maturity (spec abstraction + detailed downstream planning), but it weakens deterministic top-level traceability.
- **Recommendation**: During revalidation, either (a) enrich `spec.md` with an explicit FR mapping appendix to product-spec FR IDs, or (b) add a canonical crosswalk table in `review.md`.

### W-002: Code implementation has not started, so code-level verification remains expected-gap

- **Where**:
    - `specs/012-creator-profiles/tasks.md`
    - repository implementation paths referenced by tasks (for example `packages/api/creator-profiles-api/*`)
- **Evidence**:
    - Task list is fully unchecked (`58/58` still `[ ]`).
    - Planned creator-profiles implementation paths are not present yet.
    - Therefore `CODE_TASKS_COVERAGE = 0/58`.
- **Why not CRITICAL**: Feature status is planning/revalidation stage, so absence of code is expected at this point.
- **Recommendation**: Keep this as expected-gap until implementation phase begins; then rerun verify-full after first implementation slice.

## PASSED Findings

- **P-001 — tasks ↔ plan alignment**: `tasks.md` phase structure and dependency graph directly mirror `plan.md` implementation phases and acceptance criteria.
- **P-002 — product-spec ↔ research consistency**: personas (P11/P5/P9), discovery/follow/profile/embed value loop, analytics intent, and monetization delegation to feature 010 remain consistent.
- **P-003 — governance intent captured in planning**: GR-002 (`/api/v1/*`) and GR-007 (shared type ownership) are explicitly represented in plan/tasks/review artifacts, pending implementation validation.

## Deterministic Metrics Snapshot

- `CODE_TASKS_COVERAGE`: **0/58**
- Tasks checked `[x]`: **0**
- Tasks unchecked `[ ]`: **58**
- `spec.md` FR count: **6**
- `product-spec/product-spec.md` FR count: **30**
- `product-spec/product-spec.md` user stories: **11**
- V-model release audit missing mappings: **32**
- V-model mapped scenarios untested: **89**
