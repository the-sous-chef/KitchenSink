| User Journeys | [user-journey.md](./user-journey.md) | End-to-end journeys for handle claim, public browsing/following, creator analytics, and embed publishing.                       |
| Metrics       | [metrics.md](./metrics.md)           | Story-level metrics for handle activation, profile discovery, follow graph health, analytics usefulness, and embed adoption.    |

## Traceability Rules Applied

1. Monetization mechanics remain owned by feature 010; 012 documents delegation points only.
2. Metrics are product validation targets and do not imply implementation or execution evidence.
3. Wireframes are explicitly absent and should be generated before visual implementation work begins.
