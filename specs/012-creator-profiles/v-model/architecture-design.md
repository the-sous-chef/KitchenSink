# Architecture Design: Public Creator Profiles

**Feature Branch**: `012-creator-profiles`
**Created**: 2026-05-10
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/012-creator-profiles/v-model/system-design.md`

## Overview

Architecture splits each system component into cohesive software modules with explicit interfaces for API, scheduler, cache, and workflow boundaries. Cross-cutting observability and governance are represented explicitly so security/compliance behavior is not implicit.

## ID Schema

- **Architecture Module**: `ARCH-NNN` — sequential identifier for each module.
- **Parent System Components**: comma-separated `SYS-NNN` list (many-to-many).
- **Cross-Cutting Tag**: `[CROSS-CUTTING]` for horizontal infrastructure modules.
