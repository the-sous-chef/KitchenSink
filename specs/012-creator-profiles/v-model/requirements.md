# V-Model Requirements Specification: Public Creator Profiles

**Feature Branch**: `012-creator-profiles`
**Created**: 2026-05-10
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/012-creator-profiles/spec.md`, `specs/012-creator-profiles/research.md`, `specs/012-creator-profiles/product-spec/product-spec.md`

## Overview

Feature 012 establishes public creator identity on KitchenSink via canonical `@handle` pages, follow graph behavior, collections, embeddable widgets, analytics, and moderation/compliance controls, while explicitly delegating billing mechanics to feature 010. This requirements baseline converts FR/US/NFR intent into atomic `REQ-NNN` items that are testable and traceable through the full V-Model chain.

## Assumptions

- Audience scope S-004 (`public-profile`) remains sibling to S-003 Circle and S-002 published-lesson.
- Billing and settlement remain out-of-scope for 012 and are handled by 010-subscriptions integration contracts.
- Verification badge issuance workflow is internal operations and not implemented as creator self-service in this feature.

## Dependencies

- `002-auth0-user-auth` for authenticated identity and JWT claim verification.
- `001-sous-chef-recipe-app` for recipe ownership/visibility data used in profile and collections.
- `010-subscriptions` for monetization payment/subscription mechanics delegated by 012.
