# System Design: Public Creator Profiles

**Feature Branch**: `012-creator-profiles`
**Created**: 2026-05-10
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/012-creator-profiles/v-model/requirements.md`

## Overview

Feature 012 decomposes into creator lifecycle, public read/discovery, social graph, collection curation, embed delivery, analytics, moderation/compliance, monetization delegation, and security/privacy controls. Each `SYS-NNN` is independently testable through API contracts, scheduled jobs, or control-plane workflows and together provides full coverage of `REQ-001..REQ-018`.

## ID Schema

- **System Component**: `SYS-NNN` — sequential identifier, never renumbered.
- **Parent Requirements**: comma-separated `REQ-NNN` list per component (many-to-many).
