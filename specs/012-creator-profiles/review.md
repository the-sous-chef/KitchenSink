# Review Log: Public Creator Profiles

> Feature: `012-creator-profiles` | Status: **DRAFT — READY FOR M7 PLANNING REVIEW**
> Started: 2026-05-12
> Last Updated: 2026-05-12

**Mode**: retroactive-bootstrap
**Milestone**: M7 (Minas Tirith)
**Public Launch**: Post-1.0 (in v1, end of `M7`)
**Launch Plan**: [`v1-launch-plan.md`](../v1-launch-plan.md)

**Governance Rules**: [`governance-rules.md`](../governance-rules.md)

## Current Status

Feature 012 now has initial M7 planning artifacts required for post-1.0 implementation planning:

- [`plan.md`](./plan.md) (created)
- [`tasks.md`](./tasks.md) (created)
- [`review.md`](./review.md) (this file)

This review log captures milestone alignment, governance checkpoints, and open decisions that should be resolved during implementation and downstream sync-verify.

## M7 Alignment Snapshot

Per [`v1-launch-plan.md`](../v1-launch-plan.md), feature 012 is assigned to `M7` (Minas Tirith) and ships post-1.0 while remaining in v1 scope. Planning artifacts must support M7 entry/exit evidence and cross-feature integration readiness.

Planning baseline used:

- Feature spec: [`spec.md`](./spec.md)
- Product spec: [`product-spec/product-spec.md`](./product-spec/product-spec.md)
- Research: [`research.md`](./research.md)
- V-Model corpus: [`v-model/`](./v-model/)

## Governance Compliance Checklist

### GR-002 — API URL Prefix Standard

**Rule reference**: [`governance-rules.md#gr-002-api-url-prefix-standard`](../governance-rules.md#gr-002-api-url-prefix-standard)

- Plan/tasks constrain all 012 routes to `/api/v1/*`.
- No bare `/api/*` or bare `/v1/*` routes are introduced in 012 planning artifacts.

**Status**: **Planned compliant** (implementation validation pending).

### GR-007 — Shared Type Library Ownership

**Rule reference**: [`governance-rules.md#gr-007-shared-type-library-ownership`](../governance-rules.md#gr-007-shared-type-library-ownership)

- Plan/tasks require shared entity imports from `@kitchensink/shared-recipe-core`.
- Local duplicate shared domain types are explicitly disallowed in task planning.

**Status**: **Planned compliant** (implementation validation pending).

## Cross-Feature Boundary Review

1. **001 core recipe app**: 012 consumes recipe visibility and feed surfaces; does not redefine recipe ownership.
2. **002 auth**: 012 depends on authenticated identity and owner-scoped authorization.
3. **010 subscriptions**: 012 provides delegation endpoints only; billing/payment mechanics remain 010-owned.
4. **011 digitization**: audience scope relationship remains sibling (`circle` vs `public-profile`), not nested; both are governed by GR-014 rather than conflicting numeric aliases.
5. **013 cooking school**: 012 `CreatorProfile` stays reusable upstream for educator-facing surfaces.

Boundary risk to watch during implementation: prevent monetization logic creep into 012 beyond delegation contracts.

## Artifact Integrity Notes

- `v-model/` exists and is extensive, but current release-audit baseline is pre-implementation and still blocked on missing mapping/result ingestion.
- New plan/tasks are designed to supply the missing execution evidence path needed by downstream sync-verify and release-audit remediation.

---

## Open Questions / Decisions to carry into implementation

1. Handle-change cooldown + reservation edge-case behavior under concurrent claim attempts (policy conflict precedence).
2. Counter projection strategy finalization (`DB trigger` vs `application projector`) for `followerCount`/`followingCount` SLO.
3. Moderation and DMCA integration boundaries with notification/compliance tooling in post-1.0 sequencing.
4. Feature-flag rollout split between creator onboarding and public browse/follow exposure during M7.

These are implementation-phase decisions, not blockers for planning artifact generation.

## Approval Gate for M7 Planning Layer

Planning layer can be considered ready for Director sync-verify intake when:

1. `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and `review.md` are present and linked.
2. Milestone alignment to `M7` is explicit and consistent with [`v1-launch-plan.md`](../v1-launch-plan.md).
3. Governance anchors for GR-002 and GR-007 are present and auditable.
4. Cross-links to spec and product-spec are intact.

Current state: **Ready for Director-led sync-verify (planning layer only).**
