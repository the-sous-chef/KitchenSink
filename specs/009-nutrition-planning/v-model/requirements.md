# V-Model Requirements Specification: Nutrition Planning

**Feature Branch**: `009-nutrition-planning`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/009-nutrition-planning/spec.md`

## Overview

The Nutrition Planning feature enables users (including personal trainers and diet-conscious individuals) to create nutrition plans that define daily or weekly caloric and macronutrient targets. Plans can be linked to meal plans for compliance tracking, with the system highlighting gaps or excesses. A trainer-client model allows trainers to create plans on behalf of clients (premium). AI-powered recipe swap suggestions help users align meal plans with nutrition targets (premium).

## Assumptions

- The trainer-client relationship for nutrition planning requires explicit consent from the client user.
- Nutritional calculations are derived from the USDA Food Data (003) and Recipe App (001) features; this feature does not independently source or store raw nutritional data.
- Premium feature gating is handled by the Subscriptions feature (010); this feature only consumes the subscription status.

## Dependencies

- **006-meal-planning** (Required): Nutrition plans link to meal plans for compliance analysis.
- **003-usda-food-data** (Required): Nutritional calculations depend on food data from this feature.
- **001-sous-chef-recipe-app** (Required): Recipe nutritional data is the basis for compliance calculations.
- **002-user-auth** (Required): All features require authentication; trainer-client model requires user relationships.
- **010-subscriptions** (Referenced): Trainer nutrition planning and AI recipe swaps are premium features gated by subscription status.

| Compliance Analysis  | A comparison of the nutritional content of a linked meal plan against the targets defined in a nutrition plan, highlighting gaps or excesses.                |
| Trainer-Client Model | A relationship where a user with trainer permissions creates and manages nutrition plans on behalf of another user (the client), with client consent.        |
| Recipe Swap          | A system-suggested substitution of one recipe for another within a meal plan to better align the plan's nutritional profile with the nutrition plan targets. |
| Premium Feature      | A capability restricted to users with an active premium subscription as managed by the Subscriptions feature (010-subscriptions).                            |
