**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/009-nutrition-planning/v-model/requirements.md`

## Overview

The Nutrition Planning feature enables users to create nutrition plans with caloric and macronutrient targets, link meal plans for compliance analysis, and supports trainer-client relationships with AI-powered recipe swap suggestions for premium users. The acceptance test plan defines three-tier criteria and verification methods per requirements.
