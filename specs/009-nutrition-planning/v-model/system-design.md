# System Design: Nutrition Planning

**Feature Branch**: `009-nutrition-planning`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/009-nutrition-planning/v-model/requirements.md`

## Overview

The Nutrition Planning system decomposes into components covering plan management, compliance analysis, trainer-client workflows, AI-powered recipe swap suggestions, external integrations, and cross-cutting concerns (auth, subscription gating, type safety). Every requirement from `requirements.md` is satisfied by at least one system component.

## ID Schema

- **System Component**: `SYS-NNN` — sequential identifier for each component
- **Parent Requirements**: Comma-separated `REQ-NNN` list per component (many-to-many)
- Example: `SYS-003` with Parent Requirements `REQ-001, REQ-005` — component satisfies both requirements

| ------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------- |
| SYS-001 | Nutrition Plan Manager             | Creates, persists, and retrieves nutrition plans with daily/weekly caloric and macronutrient targets (protein, carbs, fat). Exposes CRUD operations for plans.                 | REQ-001, REQ-004          | Service   |
| SYS-002 | Meal Plan Linker                   | Associates meal plans with nutrition plans. Manages the link lifecycle (create, update, remove). Validates that referenced meal plans exist via the Meal Planning integration. | REQ-002, REQ-IF-001       | Module    |
| SYS-003 | Compliance Analyser                | Computes the gap/excess between a linked meal plan's nutritional totals and the nutrition plan's targets. Produces structured compliance results with gap/excess indicators.   | REQ-003, REQ-NF-005       | Service   |
| SYS-004 | Dashboard Visibility Controller    | Ensures created nutrition plans appear on the user's dashboard. Manages plan listing, ordering, and visibility state.                                                          | REQ-004                   | Module    |
| SYS-005 | Trainer-Client Plan Controller     | Allows users with the trainer role to create and manage nutrition plans on behalf of consenting clients. Enforces role checks and consent state before any write.              | REQ-005, REQ-006, REQ-008 | Subsystem |
| SYS-006 | Consent Manager                    | Records and enforces explicit client consent for trainer-managed nutrition plans. Provides consent grant/revoke operations and consent-state queries.                          | REQ-008                   | Module    |
| SYS-007 | AI Recipe Swap Suggester           | Analyses compliance gaps and suggests recipe swaps or adjustments to bring a meal plan into alignment with its linked nutrition targets. Premium-gated.                        | REQ-007                   | Service   |
| SYS-008 | Meal Planning Integration Adapter  | Wraps the 006-meal-planning API to retrieve meal plan nutritional totals for compliance analysis.                                                                              | REQ-IF-001, REQ-CN-001    | Subsystem |
| SYS-009 | USDA Food Data Integration Adapter | Wraps the 003-usda-food-data API to obtain per-food nutritional values used in compliance calculations.                                                                        | REQ-IF-002, REQ-CN-001    | Subsystem |
| SYS-010 | Recipe App Integration Adapter     | Wraps the 001-sous-chef-recipe-app API to obtain recipe-level nutritional data as the basis for compliance calculations.                                                       | REQ-IF-003, REQ-CN-001    | Subsystem |
| SYS-011 | Auth Integration Adapter           | Wraps the 002-user-auth service to authenticate all requests and resolve trainer-client user relationships.                                                              | REQ-IF-004, REQ-CN-001    | Subsystem |
| SYS-012 | Subscription Gate                  | Checks active premium subscription status via the 010-subscriptions feature before allowing access to trainer plan creation and AI recipe swap suggestions.                    | REQ-IF-005, REQ-CN-002    | Module    |
| SYS-013 | TypeScript Strict Compliance Layer | Cross-cutting enforcement of `strict: true` compilation, prohibition of `any`, and JSDoc documentation on all exported symbols.                                                | REQ-NF-001, REQ-NF-002    | Utility   |
| SYS-014 | Accessibility Compliance Layer     | Cross-cutting enforcement of accessible UI component names (queryable via `getByRole`/`getByLabel`) and non-color-only compliance indicators (icon/text pairing).              | REQ-NF-003, REQ-NF-004    | Utility   |
