**Branch**: `009-nutrition-planning`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Pending initial human review

**Milestone**: `M5` Isengard
**Public Launch**: 1.0 (end of `M6`)
**Launch Plan**: [`v1-launch-plan.md`](../v1-launch-plan.md)

## Purpose

This file records the iterative revalidation cycle for the Product Forge layer of feature 009. Each revision captures user feedback, the corrections applied, and an explicit approval marker.

This feature was **retroactively bootstrapped** — the SpecKit + V-Model artifacts already existed before Product Forge was layered on. Revalidation here therefore focuses on:

1. Whether the synthesized `research/` and `product-spec/` artifacts faithfully reflect the existing `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `research.md`, and `v-model/requirements.md`.
2. Whether the new artifacts surface any gaps, contradictions, or stale assumptions in upstream artifacts.
3. Whether the Must Have / Should Have / Could Have decomposition in `product-spec/product-spec.md` matches actual product priorities for nutrition planning.

| product-spec.md      | `spec.md` FR-036..FR-039, acceptance scenarios, assumptions, `v-model/requirements.md`                                    |
| user-journey.md      | `spec.md` user story acceptance scenarios + `plan.md` API/data model                                                      |
| wireframes/          | Requested wireframe set + `spec.md` FRs/NFRs                                                                              |

**Consistency checks performed**:

- Ensured all Must Have stories map to existing FR IDs (`FR-036..FR-039`) or are explicitly marked as WARNING when inferred from acceptance scenarios/assumptions.
- Preserved upstream scope boundaries (no edits to `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `v-model/`).
- Ensured artifact folder shape mirrors feature 001 bootstrap pattern.

**Known gaps identified during bootstrap**:

1. `spec.md` has only one explicit user story header, while it includes premium acceptance scenarios that behave like additional stories (trainer-client + recipe swaps). Product spec models these as separate stories for traceability but tags them back to FR-038/FR-039.
2. Dietary constraints in the task prompt (keto/vegan/allergies/medical, deficiency alerts, micronutrients) are not explicitly declared as new FR IDs in `spec.md`; treated as UX/analysis overlays with WARNING markers where they imply net-new requirement intent.

---

## Pending Human Review Questions

1. Should dietary constraints (keto/vegan/allergies/medical) remain as filtering/goal-profile metadata under FR-036, or be promoted to explicit new FR IDs?
2. Should micronutrient deficiency alerts be accepted as a scoped extension (likely new FR) or deferred to a later feature split?
3. Should AI recipe swaps remain premium-only under FR-039 for v1, or be partially available in free tier with reduced depth?
