| Artifact      | File                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Spec  | [product-spec.md](./product-spec.md)  | Vision, personas, epics, MoSCoW story map with FR traceability, and out-of-scope list. The single source of truth for what is and is not in v1.                                                                                                            |
| User Journeys | [user-journey.md](./user-journey.md)  | End-to-end flows for three personas (Home Cook, Meal Planner, Recipe Sharer) covering all P1/P2/P3 stories plus cross-persona edge cases (conflict resolution, photo failure, S3 archive failure). Includes Mermaid sequence diagrams and coverage matrix. |
| Wireframes    | [wireframes/](./wireframes/README.md) | ASCII conceptual wireframes for seven key UI screens: recipe list, recipe detail, recipe edit (multi-step), recipe search, collection view, version history, and HTTP 409 conflict resolution. Each wireframe annotates the FRs it satisfies.              |
| Metrics       | [metrics.md](./metrics.md)            | Per-story measurable outcomes for the six Must Have stories (25 metrics total). Distinguish from `research/metrics-roi.md` which covers portfolio-level ROI; this file covers story-level product-team signals.                                            |

All Must Have stories are mapped to specific FR and C IDs from `spec.md`. Should Have and Could Have stories that are Net-new (no matching FR in spec.md) are marked as such in `product-spec.md`.
