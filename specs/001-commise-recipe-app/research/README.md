This directory contains the Product Forge Phase 1 research artifacts for feature 001. Each file synthesizes existing SpecKit/V-Model output into a focused domain document.

## File Index

### [competitors.md](./competitors.md)

Competitive landscape for recipe management apps covering Paprika, Whisk, Mealime, Yummly, Cookpad, and Notion-recipe-templates. Includes a feature parity matrix, current pricing (2026), market gap analysis, and Commise differentiation thesis. Key finding: no consumer recipe app offers version history with 3-way merge + async SQS archival + pg_trgm/tsvector search — the primary differentiation opportunity.

### [ux-patterns.md](./ux-patterns.md)

UX pattern reference for recipe CRUD, search, versioning, sharing, and collections. Covers: master-detail list, optimistic save with ETag/If-Match, HTTP 409 conflict resolution modal, photo upload progress (presigned S3 + Lambda Sharp + CloudFront), faceted full-text search, soft-delete with 8-second undo, and collection management. Each pattern cites the relevant spec/plan section. Intended as a design and implementation reference.

### [codebase-analysis.md](./codebase-analysis.md)

Monorepo structure analysis grounded in root `package.json` and `turbo.json`. Covers: existing workspaces (`packages/tools/*`, `packages/apps/commise/web`, `packages/apps/commise/mobile`, `packages/ui`), new workspaces required (`api` for NestJS, `lambda-photos` for Sharp), TypeScript conventions, auth architecture (Auth0 web + mobile), data model summary, and workspace dependency graph. Gaps flagged: no test framework declared in root, E2E approach TBD, CDK stack structure TBD.

### [tech-stack.md](./tech-stack.md)

Full technology stack rationale extracted from [research.md](../research.md) RQ-1 through RQ-9 and [plan.md](../plan.md). Sections for: NestJS on Fargate, RDS PostgreSQL 16 (tsvector GIN + pg_trgm), S3 + CloudFront + Lambda Sharp photo pipeline, SQS version-archive queue + DLQ, Auth0, Next.js 15, Expo 53, Drizzle ORM, CDK v2. Each choice includes documented trade-offs from the source artifacts. RQ-to-technology mapping table included.

### [metrics-roi.md](./metrics-roi.md)

Success metrics and ROI hypothesis. Covers: operational SLOs from NFR-008..011 (CI completeness, configurable API URLs, E2E seed data, test isolation), performance SLOs from SC-009 and plan (p95 API <= 500ms, search < 2s wall-clock, recipe save <= 500ms independent of S3 archive), cost ceiling (~$25/mo RDS launch, ~$50–80/mo at 1k MAU), and growth metrics (TBD pending product input for north-star MAU, activation, W4 retention, premium conversion rate). ROI hypothesis: 8x ROI at 5,000 MAU.
