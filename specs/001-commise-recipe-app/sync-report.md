# Sync-Verify Report: 001-commise-recipe-app

**Date**: 2026-06-02 (Run #2 — post-HITL delegation analysis)
**Phase**: unknown (no `.forge-status.yml`)
**Layers checked**: 1–7 (all)
**Layers skipped**: none

## Verdict

**MIXED — open work tracked under 001**: Most of 001's capabilities are correctly **delegated** to sub-features 002–014 and progressing under their own roadmaps. **Core recipe scaffolding** (US-0 home, US-1 create/manage, US-2 share/clone, FR-001..FR-006) is **not owned by any sub-feature** and per HITL resolution (2026-06-02) will be **implemented under 001 directly** rather than spawning a new sub-feature. DRIFT-002 remains OPEN-CRITICAL until that work lands; tracked as the active implementation queue for 001.

## Per-Layer Results

### Layer 1: research/ ↔ product-spec/ — ℹ️ 1 INFO
- DRIFT-006: NFR framing differs between `research/metrics-roi.md` and `product-spec/metrics.md`. Acceptable refactor.

### Layer 2: product-spec/ ↔ spec.md — ⚠️ 1 WARNING
- DRIFT-004: Product-spec Must Have stories don't fully cover FR-003/004/009 visibility constraints.

### Layer 3: spec.md ↔ plan.md — ⚠️ 1 WARNING
- DRIFT-003: spec.md FRs (FR-003, FR-004, FR-006, FR-009, FR-014a, SC-001, SC-005) not referenced in plan.md.

### Layer 4: plan.md ↔ tasks.md — ✅ no findings

### Layer 5: tasks.md ↔ Code — 🔧 RESCOPED
- DRIFT-001: Originally CRITICAL ("182 pending tasks, 0 implementation"). Post-HITL delegation analysis: ~150 tasks are correctly delegated to sub-features 002–014 (with their own active implementations). Only ~30 orphan tasks remain — core recipe CRUD under `packages/api/recipe`, `packages/shared/recipe-core`, `packages/api/photo-processor`. **Severity reduced to RESCOPED**.

### Layer 6: spec.md ↔ Code — ❌ 1 CRITICAL + ℹ️ 1 INFO

- **DRIFT-002 (CRITICAL — OPEN, accepted)**: All 3 Must Have user stories (US-0, US-1, US-2, all P1) have **no implementation evidence**. Branch diff contains only auth/identity files from 002-user-auth. No code under `packages/api/recipe/` or `packages/shared/recipe-core/`. Core recipe data model and CRUD entirely absent.

  **HITL resolution (2026-06-02)**: Option 2 selected — **implement under 001 directly**. Meta-feature 001 will dual-purpose as both planning home and implementation owner for the recipe domain. No new sub-feature spawned. DRIFT-002 remains OPEN-CRITICAL as the active work-in-progress signal for 001 until core recipe scaffolding lands under `packages/api/recipe/`, `packages/shared/recipe-core/`, and `packages/api/photo-processor/` (or equivalent paths under `packages/apps/commise/`). Next sync-verify run should re-evaluate Layer 5 once any 001 `[x]` tasks materialize.

- DRIFT-005 (INFO): FR-045 (auth) dependency satisfied by 002-user-auth files in branch diff.

### Layer 7: Cross-link integrity — ✅ CLEAN
- 232 internal cross-links verified.
