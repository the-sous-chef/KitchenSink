# Architecture Design: Commise - Recipe Management Core

**Feature Branch**: `001-commise-recipe-app`
**Created**: 2026-05-01
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/001-commise-recipe-app/v-model/system-design.md`

## Overview

This architecture decomposes the 20 system components from `system-design.md` into 33 software modules following IEEE 42010 / Kruchten 4+1 conventions. Decomposition is driven by NestJS module boundaries on the API tier (controller → service → policy/repository), Lambda-as-module boundaries for asynchronous workers (photo processor, archive worker), client-tier separation (web orchestration vs. mobile orchestration), and explicit cross-cutting infrastructure modules for configuration, telemetry, alarming, CI governance, and dependency-injection wiring. Each SYS-NNN may map to multiple ARCH-NNN (e.g., SYS-002 splits into Controller, Command Service, DTO Validator, and Error Mapper) and each ARCH-NNN may serve multiple SYS-NNN where the implementation boundary genuinely spans them (e.g., the Drizzle Repository Layer serves SYS-014 across all data-touching commands and queries). The Process View captures five critical end-to-end flows (authenticated recipe save with versioning, photo upload pipeline, async archive lifecycle with retry/DLQ, collection clone-and-pull, and GDPR erasure orchestration). The Interface View provides explicit input/output/exception contracts for every module — no black boxes — to drive Interface Contract Testing and Interface Fault Injection in `/speckit.v-model.integration-test`.

## ID Schema

- **Architecture Module**: `ARCH-NNN` — sequential identifier for each module
- **Parent System Components**: Comma-separated `SYS-NNN` list per module (many-to-many)
- **Cross-Cutting Tag**: `[CROSS-CUTTING]` for infrastructure/utility modules not traceable to a specific SYS
- Example: `ARCH-004` with Parent System Components `SYS-002, SYS-008` — module serves both Recipe Command Service and Versioning subsystems
- Example: `ARCH-033 [CROSS-CUTTING]` — NestJS dependency-injection wiring with no single SYS parent

**Extension views (not Kruchten 4+1 named slots)**:

- `## Interface View — API Contracts (IEEE 42010 §8 Extension)` provides explicit module interface specifications required for verification.
- `## Data Flow View — Data Transformation Chains (Extension beyond Kruchten 4+1)` provides transformation-chain traceability across module boundaries.

## Process View (+1 Scenarios) — Dynamic Behavior (Kruchten 4+1)

The five scenarios below are the document's **+1 Scenarios** view and collectively exercise the Logical View module decomposition, Physical View runtime placement (API container, S3, SQS, Lambda, RDS), and Development View ownership boundaries (API/web/mobile/worker/infra packages).

### Interaction: Authenticated Recipe Save with Versioning and Archive Enqueue

```mermaid

    REPO-->>GUARD: {ownerId, tier}

    CTRL->>DTO: validate(body)
    DTO-->>CTRL: UpdateRecipeCommand | ValidationError
    CTRL->>CMD: update(command)
    CMD->>POL: evaluate(visibilityChange, tier, source)
    POL-->>CMD: {allowed, reason}
    CMD->>REPO: BEGIN TX
    CMD->>CONC: assertVersion(currentRowVersion, incomingRowVersion)
    CONC-->>CMD: ok | ConcurrencyConflict
    CMD->>REPO: updateRecipe(...)
    CMD->>VER: writeSnapshot(recipeId, newVersionNumber)
    VER->>REPO: insert recipe_versions + recipe_version_pending_archives
    REPO-->>VER: ok
    CMD->>REPO: COMMIT
    CMD->>Q: enqueueArchive(recipeId, versionNumber, pendingArchiveId)
    Q-->>CMD: enqueued | sendFailure (left for reconciler)
    CMD-->>CTRL: UpdatedRecipeView
    CTRL-->>CLI: 200 OK
    CTRL->>ERR: on any thrown DomainError → mapped HTTP error
```

**Concurrency Model**: NestJS request-per-task on Node event loop; database transaction provides isolation (`READ COMMITTED`) plus row-version compare-and-set in ARCH-016 for optimistic concurrency. Queue send (ARCH-017) executes after commit but failures are tolerated because ARCH-019 reconciler replays from the pending row.
**Synchronization Points**: (1) DB transaction commit boundary in ARCH-004; (2) row-version CAS in ARCH-016; (3) post-commit queue send (best-effort) in ARCH-017; (4) archive worker `processed_at` write in ARCH-018 only after S3 PUT confirmed.

### Interaction: Photo Upload — Presign, Confirm, Async Processing

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as ARCH-026/ARCH-027 UI
    participant CTRL as ARCH-003 Recipe Controller
    participant PRE as ARCH-012 Photo Presign Service
    participant S3 as ARCH-025 S3 Adapter
    participant CONF as ARCH-013 Photo Confirm Service
    participant LAM as ARCH-014 Photo Processing Lambda
    participant REPO as ARCH-024 Drizzle Repository

    UI->>CTRL: POST /api/v1/recipes/{id}/photos:presign
    CTRL->>PRE: createPresign(recipeId, userId, mime, size)
    PRE->>S3: signPutUrl(key, conditions)
    S3-->>PRE: {url, fields, key}
    PRE->>REPO: insert pending_photo (state="presigned")
    PRE-->>UI: {url, fields, key}
    UI->>S3: PUT object (direct upload)
    S3-->>UI: 200 OK
    UI->>CTRL: POST /api/v1/recipes/{id}/photos:confirm {key}
    CTRL->>CONF: confirm(recipeId, userId, key)
    CONF->>S3: HEAD + getObject(range=0..N) for magic-byte check
    S3-->>CONF: bytes
    CONF->>REPO: update photo state="confirmed"
    CONF-->>UI: PhotoRefView
    Note over S3,LAM: S3 ObjectCreated triggers Lambda
    S3-->>LAM: event(s3 key)
    LAM->>S3: getObject(original)
    LAM->>LAM: Sharp renditions (thumb, medium, large)
    LAM->>S3: putObject(rendition keys)
    LAM->>REPO: update photo state="processed", rendition keys
```

**Concurrency Model**: Browser/mobile uploads directly to S3 (out-of-process); Lambda concurrency is per-S3-event with reserved concurrency cap. Confirm is synchronous to API; Lambda processing is asynchronous and idempotent on object key.
**Synchronization Points**: (1) confirm magic-byte check before persisting `confirmed`; (2) Lambda writes `processed` only after all renditions PUT; retries via Lambda destination on failure.

### Interaction: Async Archive Worker with Retry/DLQ and Reconciler

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Q as SQS version-archive queue
    participant W as ARCH-018 Archive Worker
    participant REPO as ARCH-024 Drizzle Repository
    participant S3 as ARCH-025 S3 Adapter
    participant DLQ as SQS DLQ
    participant REC as ARCH-019 Pending Archive Reconciler
    participant TEL as ARCH-030 Telemetry
    participant ALM as ARCH-031 Archive Backlog Alarm

    Q-->>W: receiveMessage(pendingArchiveId)
    W->>REPO: loadPendingArchive(id)
    W->>REPO: loadVersionSnapshot(recipeId, versionNumber)
    W->>S3: putObject(versions/{recipeId}/v{n}.json)
    alt PUT success
        W->>REPO: update pending state="archived", processed_at=now
        W->>TEL: emit success metric
        W-->>Q: deleteMessage
    else PUT failure
        W->>TEL: emit failure metric
        W-->>Q: leave for redrive (visibility timeout)
        Note over Q,DLQ: After max receives → DLQ
    end
    Note over REC: Scheduled (every N minutes)
    REC->>REPO: select pending where state="pending" and age > threshold
    REC->>Q: re-enqueue
    REC->>REPO: increment attempts
    TEL->>ALM: backlog_depth, oldest_age, failure_count
    ALM-->>TEL: alarm if thresholds breached
```

**Concurrency Model**: SQS at-least-once delivery; Lambda concurrency limited by reserved capacity; reconciler runs on EventBridge schedule with single-instance lock via row-level `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.
**Synchronization Points**: (1) S3 PUT confirmation gates the pending-row state transition (no premature delete); (2) `SKIP LOCKED` prevents reconciler/worker double-processing; (3) DLQ threshold gates manual replay.

### Interaction: Collection Clone and User-Initiated Pull Reconciliation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as ARCH-026/ARCH-027 UI
    participant CTRL as ARCH-003 Recipe Controller
    participant COL as ARCH-020 Collection Service
    participant CLONE as ARCH-021 Clone & Pull Service
    participant POL as ARCH-006 Visibility Policy Engine
    participant REPO as ARCH-024 Drizzle Repository

    UI->>CTRL: POST /api/v1/collections/{id}/clone
    CTRL->>CLONE: cloneFromSource(sourceCollectionId, userId)
    CLONE->>POL: assertSourceVisible(source, principal)
    CLONE->>REPO: snapshot source members (recipe_ids @ snapshot_at)
    CLONE->>REPO: insert new collection + memberships + source_link
    CLONE-->>UI: ClonedCollectionView

    UI->>CTRL: POST /api/v1/collections/{id}/pull
    CTRL->>CLONE: pullFromSource(targetId, userId)
    CLONE->>REPO: load target + source_link
    CLONE->>REPO: diff(source.current_members, target.members_at_last_pull)
    CLONE->>REPO: apply add+remove (no overwrite of user-added)
    CLONE-->>UI: PullReportView {added, removed, skipped}
```

**Concurrency Model**: Single transaction per pull; per-collection advisory lock prevents concurrent pulls on the same target.
**Synchronization Points**: PostgreSQL advisory lock keyed on `target_collection_id` for the pull duration.

### Interaction: GDPR Erasure Orchestration (Idempotent)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ADMIN as Admin/Trigger
    participant ORCH as ARCH-022 Erasure Orchestrator
    participant REPO as ARCH-024 Drizzle Repository
    participant PURG as ARCH-023 Storage Purger
    participant S3 as ARCH-025 S3 Adapter
    participant TEL as ARCH-030 Telemetry

    ADMIN->>ORCH: enqueueErasure(userId)
    ORCH->>REPO: insert account_erasure_jobs (state="pending")
    loop Worker tick
        ORCH->>REPO: lease next job FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
        ORCH->>REPO: purge user-owned rows (recipes, collections, versions, pending_archives)
        ORCH->>PURG: purgeUserStorage(userId)
        PURG->>S3: list + batch delete photo prefixes
        PURG->>S3: list + batch delete version-archive prefixes
        PURG-->>ORCH: {deleted_objects}
        ORCH->>REPO: update job state="completed"
        ORCH->>TEL: emit erasure_completed
    end
```

**Concurrency Model**: Single-leader leasing via `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` on `account_erasure_jobs`; per-job idempotent (replays safely on partial completion via state transitions).
**Synchronization Points**: (1) job lease boundary; (2) RDS purge committed before S3 purge to ensure references are gone; (3) S3 batch delete is retried on partial-failure responses.

- **Region strategy**: Primary deployment in one AWS region (for example `us-east-1`) with managed regional services: VPC, RDS PostgreSQL 16, SQS queues, Lambda workers, and ECS Fargate API runtime.
- **Network layout**:
    - Public edge: CloudFront distribution terminating TLS for web static assets and image/object delivery from S3 via Origin Access Control (ARCH-025).
    - Private application plane: API runtime in private subnets (ECS Fargate service behind ALB) hosting NestJS modules (ARCH-003, ARCH-004, ARCH-010, ARCH-020, ARCH-021, ARCH-022, ARCH-028, ARCH-029, ARCH-030, ARCH-033).
    - Data plane: RDS PostgreSQL in isolated/private subnets accessed through security groups by API and worker runtimes (ARCH-024).
    - Async plane: SQS main queue + DLQ for version archives (ARCH-017 producer, ARCH-018 worker, ARCH-019 reconciler, ARCH-031 alarm).
- **Stateful services**:
    - **RDS PostgreSQL 16** stores recipes, versions, pending archives, collections, erasure jobs (primarily ARCH-024, invoked by ARCH-004/ARCH-015/ARCH-022).
    - **S3 buckets** store recipe photos/renditions and archived version objects (ARCH-012, ARCH-013, ARCH-014, ARCH-018, ARCH-023, ARCH-025).
    - **CloudFront CDN** fronts web and signed/static object delivery paths (ARCH-025).
- **Compute services**:
    - **NestJS API container runtime** (ECS Fargate) executes synchronous request path and orchestration modules (ARCH-001, ARCH-002, ARCH-003, ARCH-004, ARCH-005, ARCH-006, ARCH-007, ARCH-008, ARCH-009, ARCH-010, ARCH-011, ARCH-012, ARCH-013, ARCH-015, ARCH-016, ARCH-017, ARCH-020, ARCH-021, ARCH-022, ARCH-024, ARCH-028, ARCH-029, ARCH-030, ARCH-033).
    - **Photo processor Lambda** executes Sharp rendition pipeline from S3 events (ARCH-014).
    - **Version-archive worker Lambda** consumes SQS archive jobs and writes version objects to S3 (ARCH-018).
    - **Scheduled reconciler Lambda/cron compute** re-enqueues stale pending archives (ARCH-019).
- **Clients (outside VPC)**:
    - **Web app** (ARCH-026) served via CloudFront/Next.js deployment surface; calls API over HTTPS with Auth0 bearer tokens.
    - **Mobile app** (ARCH-027, Expo React Native) communicates directly with API and presigned S3 upload targets.

## Scenarios View (+1) — Critical End-to-End Flows (Kruchten +1)

The +1 Scenarios View exercises the architecture through five end-to-end flows. Each scenario has a trigger, primary actor, precondition, basic flow, expected outcome, and at least one alternate/exception path per ISO 42010 §7.4 guidance.

### Scenario Map

| Scenario ID | Flow Name                              | Primary Actor           | Trigger                                               | Expected Outcome                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| SCN-001     | Authenticated Recipe Save + Versioning | Authenticated user      | User submits recipe form with expectedVersion current | Version incremented; snapshot archived to S3              |
| SCN-002     | Photo Upload Pipeline                  | Authenticated user      | User attaches photo file to recipe form               | Photo confirmed, processed, renditions available          |
| SCN-003     | Async Archive Lifecycle with DLQ Retry | System (queue consumer) | Archive message processed; S3 write succeeds/fails    | Archive object written OR redriven to DLQ after 3 retries |
| SCN-004     | Collection Clone + Pull Reconciliation | Authenticated user      | User clones public collection and optionally pulls    | Members copied; pull report shows add/remove/skipped      |
| SCN-005     | GDPR Erasure Orchestration             | System (erasure job)    | GDPR erasure request accepted                         | DB records soft-deleted; S3 objects purged; job completed |

### SCN-001 — Authenticated Recipe Save + Versioning

**Trigger:** Authenticated user submits recipe create/update form.

**Precondition:** User is authenticated; recipe has `currentVersion = N`.

**Basic Flow:**

1. Client sends `POST /api/v1/recipes` with `expectedVersion = null` (create) or `PATCH /api/v1/recipes/{id}` with `expectedVersion = N` (update).
2. ARCH-001 verifies JWT; ARCH-002 checks owner/tier authorization.
3. ARCH-004 validates DTO via ARCH-005; resolves ingredient IDs via ARCH-008.
4. ARCH-004 writes to ARCH-024 in transaction, incrementing version to `N+1`.
5. ARCH-017 enqueues archive message to ARCH-018 via ARCH-025 (SQS).
6. HTTP 200/201 returned with new recipe including `currentVersion = N+1`.

**Alternate Path (optimistic concurrency conflict):**
1a. Client sends `PATCH` with `expectedVersion = N` but server has `N+1`.
2a. ARCH-004 throws 409; client receives conflict resolution UI.
3a. User chooses keep-server / overwrite-local / merge-fields; retry succeeds.

**Expected Outcome:** Version incremented atomically; archive message enqueued; no silent merge.

---

### SCN-002 — Photo Upload Pipeline

**Trigger:** Authenticated user attaches a file to a recipe via upload widget.

**Precondition:** Recipe record exists; user is owner.

**Basic Flow:**

1. Client requests presign URL via `POST /api/v1/recipes/{id}/photos/presign`.
2. ARCH-012 validates MIME/size; inserts pending row via ARCH-024; returns `{ url, key }`.
3. Client PUTs file directly to S3; S3 event triggers Lambda (ARCH-014).
4. ARCH-014 confirms magic bytes via ARCH-025 HEAD; updates DB state to `confirmed`.
5. ARCH-014 runs Sharp transforms; writes `thumb/medium/large` to S3; updates DB to `processed`.
6. Client sees processed photo in recipe view.

**Alternate Path (magic bytes mismatch):**
4a. ARCH-014 detects MIME mismatch; marks photo `failed`; client receives error via polling/SSE.

**Expected Outcome:** Confirmed photo with all three renditions; no spoofed MIME accepted.

---

### SCN-003 — Async Archive Lifecycle with DLQ Retry

**Trigger:** Archive message arrives on `archive-queue` SQS queue (ARCH-017 → ARCH-018).

**Precondition:** Recipe version snapshot exists; S3 writable.

**Basic Flow:**

1. ARCH-018 receives message `{ pendingArchiveId, recipeId, versionNumber }`.
2. ARCH-018 loads snapshot via ARCH-024.
3. ARCH-018 writes `versions/{recipeId}/v{versionNumber}.json` via ARCH-025 (S3).
4. ARCH-018 marks pending row `archived`; returns empty `batchItemFailures[]`.
5. SQS acks message; ARCH-018 ready for next.

**Alternate Path (S3 write failure):**
4a. ARCH-018 catches S3 error; returns `batchItemFailures = [{ itemIdentifier: pendingArchiveId }]`.
5a. SQS redrives message to same consumer; attempt count increments.
6a. After 3 attempts, message moves to DLQ; ARCH-019 detects via `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible > 0` alarm.
7a. On-call operator replay via runbook.

**Expected Outcome:** Archive object written; DLQ alerts if exhausted retries.

---

### SCN-004 — Collection Clone + Pull Reconciliation

**Trigger:** Authenticated user clones a public collection OR triggers "Pull updates" on an existing clone.

**Precondition:** Source collection is public and owned by another user.

**Basic Flow:**

1. Client sends `POST /api/v1/collections/{id}/clone`.
2. ARCH-020 validates source visibility via ARCH-006; acquires advisory lock.
3. ARCH-021 snapshots source and target; computes diff.
4. ARCH-021 writes clone memberships via ARCH-024 in single transaction; releases lock.
5. ARCH-021 returns `{ added[], removed[], skipped[], snapshotAt }` with attribution preserved.

**Pull Updates Path:**

1. Client sends `POST /api/v1/collections/{cloneId}/pull`.
2. ARCH-021 re-snapshots source; diffs against clone; applies adds/removes.
3. Returns pull report with same envelope.

**Expected Outcome:** Clone has snapshot-time members; pull report is deterministic.

---

### SCN-005 — GDPR Erasure Orchestration

**Trigger:** Authenticated user or operator initiates account erasure.

**Precondition:** User consent captured; erasure job accepted.

**Basic Flow:**

1. ARCH-022 creates `account_erasure_jobs` row `queued`.
2. ARCH-022 emits `ERASURE_REQUESTED` operational state; transitions job to `running`.
3. ARCH-023 issues DB deletes via ARCH-024 per GDPR-safe ordering (recipes → ingredients → users).
4. ARCH-023 issues S3 prefix deletes via ARCH-025 (`users/{userId}/photos/`, `users/{userId}/versions/`).
5. ARCH-023 marks job `completed`; emits `ERASURE_COMPLETED` state.

**Partial Failure Path:**
4a. S3 batch partially fails; ARCH-023 returns `STORAGE_PURGE_PARTIAL` with `remaining[]`.
5a. Operator reruns via archival on remaining keys.
5b. On retry exhaustion, job marked `failed` with remaining keys logged.

**Expected Outcome:** All PII removed from DB and S3; audit trail retained; job reaches terminal state.

| AD-001      | Use **NestJS** as the API framework for synchronous command/query endpoints.                                     | Express (minimal custom stack); Fastify standalone; serverless-only route handlers.                          | NestJS aligns with module/DI boundaries captured by ARCH-003/004/010/020/021/022/028/033, supports guard/filter patterns (ARCH-001/002/028), and improves testability via provider injection. | Invalid if startup/memory overhead breaches target SLO/cost envelope or team migrates to a framework-standardized platform requiring a different runtime model.                                         |
| AD-002      | Use **SQS** for version archive queueing between ARCH-017 and ARCH-018.                                          | EventBridge bus fan-out; direct synchronous invocation of archive worker Lambda; DB polling without queue.   | SQS provides explicit at-least-once delivery, DLQ redrive, backpressure handling, and deterministic replay compatibility with pending archive rows and ARCH-019 reconciler semantics.         | Invalid if archive workflow must become strongly ordered exactly-once with cross-region fan-out beyond SQS design assumptions.                                                                          |
| AD-003      | Use **optimistic concurrency** (ARCH-016) for recipe updates.                                                    | Pessimistic row locks (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`); last-write-wins; CRDT merge strategy.                       | Optimistic CAS preserves user-visible conflict semantics (REQ-042/043), avoids long lock hold times on interactive edits, and scales better for mostly non-contentious writes.                | Invalid if observed write contention rate produces excessive 409 conflicts and materially degrades UX compared with lock-based coordination.                                                            |
| AD-004      | Use **Lambda** for photo processing (ARCH-014).                                                                  | Sidecar/container image processor in API runtime; ECS background worker service; third-party media pipeline. | Event-driven Lambda directly matches S3 ObjectCreated events, isolates CPU/burst image workloads from API latency path, and enables independent scaling/retries.                              | Invalid if image workload requires persistent GPU/large-memory processing profiles that exceed practical Lambda limits or if end-to-end processing latency targets tighten beyond cold-start tolerance. |
| AD-005      | Use **Drizzle ORM** for persistence abstraction (ARCH-024).                                                      | Raw SQL + hand-rolled repositories; Prisma ORM; TypeORM.                                                     | Drizzle offers strongly typed schema/query ergonomics with low abstraction overhead and preserves explicit SQL control required for performance-sensitive search/versioning paths.            | Invalid if schema/query complexity demands richer migration/runtime capabilities unavailable in Drizzle or if team-standard tooling mandates another ORM.                                               |
| AD-006      | Model **ARCH-033 as [CROSS-CUTTING] NestJS DI wiring** spanning SYS-001/SYS-002/SYS-014/SYS-018/SYS-019/SYS-020. | Duplicate DI/bootstrap wiring per feature module; collapse wiring into infrastructure-only SYS ownership.    | Centralized root/module wiring keeps provider graph deterministic, enforces shared guard/filter/config/telemetry composition, and supports CI-governed bootstrap invariants.                  | Invalid if the codebase is split into independently deployable bounded contexts where central AppModule wiring becomes a release bottleneck.                                                            |
