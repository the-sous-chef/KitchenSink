# Market and Competitive Analysis

## Evidence boundary

This analysis is a strategic landscape assessment, not a validated market-sizing model. External market-size estimates for recipe, meal-planning, nutrition, grocery, creator, education, and AI food apps vary materially by source and methodology. Treat competitor positions and market trends as directional inputs for discovery, pricing tests, and GTM hypotheses until Apron has first-party user, conversion, retention, and willingness-to-pay data.

## Market thesis

The cooking-app market appears crowded but fragmented. Users currently stitch together recipe storage, meal planning, grocery shopping, nutrition tracking, creator content, AI chat, and cooking education across separate tools. Commise can compete if it proves that one connected household cooking workflow creates more repeat use than point solutions.

Market-sizing reports vary widely and should be treated directionally, not as precise truth. The strongest current evidence is behavioral and indirect: consumers already spend across groceries, subscriptions, food content, nutrition apps, creator memberships, and cooking education. The opportunity hypothesis is to capture workflow share before competitors consolidate these jobs.

## AI behavior shift

AI is moving from novelty to a real consumer cooking behavior. The Spring
2026 MorganMyers Food Pulse reported that 36% of surveyed consumers used
ChatGPT or other AI tools for recipe discovery in the past month, 41% used AI
for meal planning, 34% used AI to modify a recipe, and 25% used AI to generate
a grocery list. Social media still leads inspiration, but AI is already acting
as a planning, modification, and execution layer.

OpenAI also positions ChatGPT directly for cooking, grocery shopping, meal
prep, substitutions, family meal plans, macro balancing, budget planning, and
food-safety questions. This creates a substitution risk for any recipe app that
only stores static recipes. If users can ask a general AI system what to cook,
adapt the answer, and generate a list, a standalone recipe box becomes less
valuable unless it owns persistence, trust, household context, and execution.

The winning AI position should therefore not be "AI recipe generator." That
space is already crowded. The stronger opportunity is **trusted AI recipe
infrastructure**: generate or import ideas, save them as user-owned recipes,
attach provenance and confidence signals, plan meals, create grocery lists,
guide cooking, and allow external agents to interact with the user's recipe
graph through explicit consent.

## Competitive segments

| Segment               | Competitors                                                     | Strengths                                                      | Weaknesses Commise can exploit                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Recipe management     | Paprika, Samsung Food, Plan to Eat, Recipe Keeper               | Importing, organization, durable utility                       | Limited integrated nutrition, creator monetization, AI, and grocery execution.                  |
| Meal planning         | Mealime, Eat This Much, Plan to Eat, Samsung Food               | Planning efficiency, diet filters, shopping lists              | Weak recipe ownership, household collaboration, creator/ecosystem expansion.                    |
| Grocery/shopping      | AnyList, Instacart, Walmart, Chicory, SideChef                  | Commerce integrations, list management, retailer relationships | Often disconnected from personal recipes, meal planning, and cooking execution.                 |
| Nutrition             | MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, Noom, Lose It                         | Tracking depth, goal orientation, habit loops                  | Not recipe-first; often feels clinical or logging-heavy.                                        |
| Cooking content       | NYT Cooking, Tasty, Cookpad, YouTube, Substack, Patreon         | Brand/content scale, creator distribution                      | Weak end-to-end utility and limited structured personal workflow.                               |
| Cooking education     | MasterClass, Udemy, YouTube, creator courses                    | High-quality content and creator reach                         | Poor integration with meal planning, grocery, nutrition, and recipe execution.                  |
| AI cooking assistants | ChatGPT, ChefGPT, DishGen, Recipy, SideChef AI, Samsung Food AI | Fast generation, conversational UX                             | AI alone is commoditizing; trust, provenance, saved context, and workflow integration are gaps. |

## AI competitor read

The CEO-level read is nuanced: competitors are already doing AI recipes, but
few appear to own the full trusted workflow.

| Competitor type             | Examples                                               | What they prove                                                                                               | Commise opening                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| General AI assistants       | ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity                            | Users can get recipes, substitutions, meal plans, budget ideas, and food-safety answers without a recipe app. | Become the persistent system of record and execution layer for AI cooking intent.                               |
| Pure AI recipe generators   | DishGen, ChefGPT, ChefPro-style tools                  | Prompt-to-recipe, pantry recipes, macros recipes, and meal plans are now table stakes.                        | Differentiate through saved recipe ownership, cooking mode, grocery flow, confidence UX, and household context. |
| Integrated food platforms   | Samsung Food AI, SideChef AI, Instacart Cart Assistant | Large platforms are tying AI to planning, shopping, personalization, and connected cooking.                   | Avoid retailer or appliance lock-in; provide provider-agnostic AI and user-owned recipe data.                   |
| Traditional recipe managers | Paprika, Plan to Eat, Recipe Keeper                    | Durable utility and import still matter.                                                                      | Use AI to accelerate capture, cleanup, personalization, and planning without weakening the recipe hub.          |

Feature `005-ai-integration` already supports this strategy: in-app BYOK AI
generation, external-agent OAuth access for platforms such as ChatGPT or
Gemini, preview-before-save, default-private AI saves, confidence indicators,
hallucination guard messaging, and revocable consent. These are stronger
strategic assets than generic generation alone.

## Strategic whitespace

1. **Integrated household utility**: Most competitors own one job. Commise can own the loop.
2. **Recipe as the hub**: Every feature should attach to recipe objects: nutrition, planning, grocery, cooking mode, creator attribution, and education.
3. **Trust and provenance**: AI-generated food content needs confidence, attribution, safety disclaimers, and nutrition-source clarity.
4. **Creator monetization**: Food creators need revenue beyond ads, sponsorships, and platform dependence. Commise can provide shoppable recipes, premium profiles, courses, and affiliate/subscription revenue paths.
5. **Context-aware AI**: AI should know the user's recipes, pantry assumptions, nutrition goals, family preferences, plan, grocery context, and cooking history — not operate as a generic chat box.
6. **AI persistence layer**: AI answers are ephemeral unless saved, structured, attributed, and connected to execution. Commise can turn AI output into durable household cooking infrastructure.
7. **External-agent bridge**: Users will keep using ChatGPT, Gemini, and other agents. Commise should meet them there through explicit OAuth consent rather than forcing every AI interaction into the app.

## Competitive positioning

| Dimension      | Commise target position                                                                                                 |

## Strategic warning

Commise should not compete as “another AI recipe app.” That category is
commoditizing quickly. The winning position is **trusted cooking infrastructure
for households and creators**, with AI as an accelerant inside the loop and
Commise as the durable system of record for recipes, plans, grocery context,
and cooking outcomes.
