# Acceptance Test Plan: AI Integration

**Feature Branch**: `005-ai-integration`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/005-ai-integration/v-model/requirements.md`, `specs/005-ai-integration/v-model/system-test.md`

## Overview

This document defines the Acceptance Test Plan for the AI Integration feature. It maps every functional, non-functional, interface, and constraint requirement from `requirements.md` to one or more BDD-style acceptance test scenarios (AT-NNN-X), each with specific pass criteria. Acceptance tests verify that the feature delivers the agreed user outcomes — they are the last line of verification before a feature is considered shippable.

**ID Schema:**

- **Acceptance Test Case**: `AT-NNN-X` — where NNN is the feature identifier (005), X is a sequential letter (A, B, C...)
- **Acceptance Test Scenario**: `ATS-NNN-X#` — nested under the parent AT, with numeric suffix (1, 2, 3...)
- Example: `ATS-005-A1` → Scenario 1 of Test Case A (BYOK provider configuration) for feature 005

**Test Strategy:**

- **Happy path** → end-to-end flow from user action to persisted outcome
- **Negative path** → error conditions, missing credentials, unauthorized access
- **Boundary** → latency (15 s), authorization scope limits, consent revocation
- **Inspection** → TypeScript strict mode, JSDoc coverage, accessibility naming

## Acceptance Test Cases (Tier 1–3 Structure)

### Tier 1: Feature Epic

### Tier 2: User Story / Requirement

## Exit Criteria

For feature 005 to be considered shippable, ALL gates below must be green:

**Gate 1 — Functional Completeness**

- [ ] All 15 functional requirements (REQ-001 through REQ-015) have passing acceptance test scenarios
- [ ] Happy path, error path, and boundary scenarios all pass
- [ ] No requirement marked "Test" is unverified by a running test

**Gate 2 — Security**

- [ ] API keys encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM); verified by code inspection + DB dump check
- [ ] No raw API key appears in any log, error message, or response body
- [ ] Unauthenticated requests to `/ai/*` and `/agent/*` return 401
- [ ] Unauthorized agent requests return 403
- [ ] Consent revocation immediately blocks agent access

**Gate 3 — Type Safety & Accessibility**

- [ ] `tsc --strict` exits with code 0
- [ ] JSDoc present on all exported functions and interfaces
- [ ] All new UI components have `getByRole`/`getByLabel` accessible names
- [ ] No color-only state indicators in any new UI component

**Gate 4 — AI Latency**

- [ ] 95th-percentile AI generation latency ≤ 15 s (measured from request start to first byte of draft response)
- [ ] Timeout (504) returned when provider exceeds 15 s

**Gate 5 — OAuth & Agent Authorization**

- [ ] External agent OAuth flow completes successfully end-to-end
- [ ] Scope-enforcement verified: `recipes:read`-only token cannot call `recipes:create`
- [ ] User can revoke agent access; revoked agent token rejected even if otherwise valid

**Gate 6 — Premium Gating**

- [ ] Free-tier users receive 402 on AI generation and instruction optimization
- [ ] Premium users access AI generation and instruction optimization without restriction
