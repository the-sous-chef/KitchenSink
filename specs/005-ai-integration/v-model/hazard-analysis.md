# Hazard Analysis (FMEA): AI Integration

**Feature Branch**: `005-ai-integration`
**Created**: 2026-05-10
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/005-ai-integration/v-model/system-design.md`
**Standard**: General-Purpose FMEA (non-regulated software; `domain: ''`)

## Overview

This document presents the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for the **AI Integration** feature. Every canonical system component (`SYS-001`..`SYS-008`) from `system-design.md` is assessed for realistic failure modes. Each hazard receives a unique `HAZ-NNN` identifier and is linked to risk-control measures (`REQ-NNN` / `SYS-NNN` / `ARCH-NNN`), enabling the traceability chain: Hazard → Mitigation → Requirement → Test Case (Matrix H in `traceability-matrix.md`).

**Non-regulated context.** Sous Chef is a consumer recipe-management application. There are no life-safety, vehicle-control, medical-device, or aviation-control concerns. Severity is measured against **user trust, data integrity, privacy, availability, and platform cost** — not personal injury. Safety-critical taxonomies (ISO 26262 ASIL, DO-178C DAL, IEC 62304) are intentionally **not** applied.

## ID Schema

- **Hazard ID**: `HAZ-{NNN}` — 3-digit zero-padded, sequential (HAZ-001, HAZ-002, ...). Never renumbered.
- **Lineage**: From any `HAZ-NNN`, the Mitigation column lists `REQ-*`, `SYS-*`, and `ARCH-*` references. The full chain to verification test cases (`ATP-*`, `STP-*`, `ITP-*`, `UTP-*`) lives in `traceability-matrix.md` (Matrix H — Hazard Traceability).

## Risk Matrix Definition

### Severity Scale (consumer SaaS — recipe app)

| Level        | Definition                                                                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Catastrophic | Cross-tenant data leak, broad unauthorized access, persistent user recipe loss, or platform-wide outage.     |
| Critical     | Individual-user data loss without recovery, authorization bypass, or sustained core-flow outage (≥1 hour).   |
| Serious      | Recoverable degradation: failed AI actions with retry path, transient endpoint 5xx, or stale-state workflow. |
| Minor        | Annoyance: degraded response quality, retryable timeout, temporary UX friction.                              |
| Negligible   | Cosmetic only: log noise, telemetry drift, copy/wording inconsistency.                                       |

### Likelihood Scale

| Level      | Definition                                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frequent   | Expected regularly under normal load (≥1× per day).             |
| Probable   | Expected occasionally (≥1× per week per 1k MAU).                |
| Occasional | Expected rarely (≥1× per month per 1k MAU).                     |
| Remote     | Possible under unusual conditions (≥1× per quarter).            |
| Improbable | Conceivable only under stacked failure or adversarial behavior. |

### Risk Level Matrix

|              | Frequent     | Probable     | Occasional   | Remote      | Improbable  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Catastrophic | Unacceptable | Unacceptable | Unacceptable | Undesirable | Undesirable |
| Critical     | Unacceptable | Unacceptable | Undesirable  | Undesirable | Tolerable   |
| Serious      | Unacceptable | Undesirable  | Undesirable  | Tolerable   | Tolerable   |
| Minor        | Undesirable  | Tolerable    | Tolerable    | Tolerable   | Acceptable  |
| Negligible   | Tolerable    | Tolerable    | Acceptable   | Acceptable  | Acceptable  |

**Disposition rule**: `Unacceptable` MUST be mitigated to `Undesirable` or lower before release. `Undesirable` MUST have explicit residual-risk acceptance recorded in this document. `Tolerable`/`Acceptable` are accepted as-is.

## Operational States

`system-design.md` does not define a formal operational-state taxonomy. For state-dependent hazards, this analysis uses the following practical operating modes:

| State             | Definition                                                                    | Source                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| NORMAL            | Steady-state operation under expected load and provider availability.         | Implicit                  |
| DEGRADED-PROVIDER | AI provider elevated errors/latency, fallback/retry and timeout paths active. | SYS-002, SYS-006          |
| AUTH-EXCHANGE     | OAuth authorization code + token exchange in progress.                        | SYS-004                   |
| RATE-LIMITED      | Upstream/downstream quota or rate-limit responses active.                     | SYS-002, SYS-005, SYS-006 |
| RECOVERY          | Service restart/deployment window with token/cache warmup in progress.        | SYS-004, SYS-005          |

## Hazard Register (FMEA)

> One or more `HAZ-NNN` per `SYS-NNN`. Mitigations cite existing `REQ-*`, `SYS-*`, and `ARCH-*` identifiers only.

## Domain Note (non-regulated)

This analysis intentionally omits regulated-domain artifacts (ASIL classification, DAL assignment, MC/DC obligations, IEC 62304 software safety classification). This feature is non-regulated consumer SaaS; severity is framed against user trust, data integrity, privacy, availability, and platform cost.

| FMEA              | Failure Mode and Effects Analysis — structured enumeration of failure modes, effects, and mitigations per component.             |
| Hazard            | A realistic failure mode whose effect, if unmitigated, would breach a system invariant (privacy, integrity, availability, cost). |
| Operational state | Named system mode where severity/likelihood may differ (NORMAL, DEGRADED-PROVIDER, AUTH-EXCHANGE, RATE-LIMITED, RECOVERY).       |
| Risk level        | Composite of severity × likelihood per the matrix above.                                                                         |
| Residual risk     | Risk level remaining after stated mitigation is in place.                                                                        |
