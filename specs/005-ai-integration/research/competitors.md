## Competitive Landscape Overview

AI recipe experiences now split into two models:

1. **Platform-provided AI** (opaque prompts, centralized model billing, tight product lock-in).
2. **BYOK-style AI tooling** (user-controlled provider and spend), still uncommon in consumer cooking products.

Feature 005 targets the gap between those models: in-app BYOK generation plus OAuth-authorized external-agent access.

## Pricing / Cost Posture Comparison

| Model                  | Typical Competitor Posture                      | Commise 005 Strategy                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AI call cost bearer    | Platform pays, recovers via subscription/upsell | User pays their provider directly (BYOK)                                |
| Marginal cost exposure | Scales with user generation volume              | Near-zero inference pass-through cost                                   |
| Price complexity       | Requires per-tier token quota policies          | Reduced platform complexity; keys and usage under user provider account |

---

## Market Gaps Commise Targets

1. **Control gap**: Let users choose provider/model path (`FR-015`) instead of forcing a single black-box AI tier.
2. **Interoperability gap**: First-class OAuth external-agent access (`FR-018`, `FR-021`) while preserving account consent boundaries.
3. **Trust gap**: Confidence indicators + explicit fallback UX for low-confidence or failed generation surfaces.
4. **Ownership gap**: Persist generated outputs as private, user-owned artifacts (`FR-020`) with explicit save intent (`FR-017`).

---

## Differentiation Thesis

Feature 005 differentiates by combining:

- **BYOK economics** (user cost control),
- **Provider agnosticism** (reduced lock-in),
- **OAuth external-agent platform reach**, and
- **guardrailed UX** tuned for reliability over novelty.

This combination is stronger than a generic “AI recipe generator” claim and directly supports long-term platform defensibility.
