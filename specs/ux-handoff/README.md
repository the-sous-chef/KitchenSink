# Commise UX Handoff Package

**Owner**: Product
**Status**: Ready for UX discovery and low-/mid-fidelity mockups; high-fidelity design remains gated by open decisions listed in [05-open-decisions.md](./05-open-decisions.md).
**Last updated**: 2026-05-10

This package is the portfolio-level UX source of truth for Commise. Feature-level product specs, journeys, and wireframes are distributed across `specs/001-*` through `specs/014-*`; `001`–`010` have split-out journeys and wireframes, while `011`–`014` currently keep journey/mockup context inside their product specs. UX should use this directory as the starting point, then drill into the linked feature specs for detail.

For executive strategy, market, business-case, and readiness framing, use the companion [executive product packet](../executive/README.md).

## What UX can start now

UX can begin:

- App-wide information architecture and navigation models for web and mobile.
- Low-/mid-fidelity mockups for the signed-in Home experience, Recipes, Meal Planning, Grocery Lists, Cooking Mode, Nutrition Planning, Subscription/paywall surfaces, AI generation/agent consent, and account/auth flows.
- User-flow diagrams for cross-feature paths such as recipe → meal plan → grocery list → online order status.
- State modeling for empty, loading, error, offline, permission, paywall, and cross-device parity states.

UX should not treat this as final visual design approval. The V-Model and implementation/test gates remain blocked; this handoff is for product/UX design readiness, not release readiness.

## Product principles for UX

- **Useful free tier**: free users can cook, organize, share, manually plan meals, generate grocery lists, and use Cooking Mode. Premium prompts must be contextual and respectful, not disruptive.
- **Web/mobile lockstep**: every user-facing surface requires equivalent web and mobile treatment unless an explicit exception is documented.
- **Recipes are the hub**: recipe cards connect nutrition, meal planning, grocery lists, cooking mode, AI, sharing/cloning, and public/private visibility.
- **Cross-link everything that users mentally connect**: meal plans link to grocery lists, grocery lists link back to meal plans, recipes link to meal plans and Cooking Mode, nutrition plans link to meal plans and recipe swaps.
- **Trust before automation**: AI, nutrition, importing, and grocery ordering must show source/quality/confidence/status clearly before users commit.
