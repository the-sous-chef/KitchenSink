## Overview

### What We're Building

A photo-to-recipe pipeline that turns paper recipes (handwritten cards, cookbook pages, magazine clippings) into structured, editable `Recipe` entities, paired with a private invite-based sharing primitive (`Circle`) consumed by features 001 / 006 / 007.

### Why We're Building It

Decades of family recipes exist only on paper — fragile, unsearchable, and locked to whoever physically holds them. No mainstream recipe app combines high-quality handwriting OCR, structured normalisation, and a named-circle sharing model. 011 closes that gap and unlocks the heritage-archivist use case (P10 Sage) plus a reusable sharing primitive for the rest of the portfolio.

### Research Backing

- **Competitor analysis:** Cookmate has correction UX but no social layer; Google Lens has best-in-class handwriting OCR but no recipe normalisation. The differentiator is correction UX over a normalised schema. (See [research.md § Competitive Landscape](./research.md))
- **UX/UI patterns:** Side-by-side correction screen (left = original photo with pinch-to-zoom, right = parsed fields with inline editing). Low-confidence tokens highlighted in amber + icon (NFR-004). Bulk-mode queue advances automatically. (See [research.md § UX Patterns](./research.md))
- **Codebase analysis:** Three new packages: `@kitchensink/digitization-ocr` (Lambda), `@kitchensink/digitization-api` (NestJS), `@kitchensink/circles-api` (NestJS), plus shared `@kitchensink/shared-audience` consumed by 001 / 006 / 007. (See [research.md § Codebase Analysis](./research.md))

## Goals

### Primary Goal

A user can photograph any paper recipe and receive a fully structured, editable `Recipe` in under 3 minutes (median), then share it privately with a named `Circle`.

### Secondary Goals

1. Define and ship the cross-feature `Circle` primitive + the `circle` audience scope (S-004) so 001 / 006 / 007 can reuse it without re-implementing sharing.
2. Provide a correction UX that respects user effort: inline editing, original photo always visible, low-confidence highlights, accept-all shortcut.
3. Support bulk import flows (≤ 20 photos / session) for power-user archive runs without blocking the API.

### Non-Goals (v1 scope)

- Web-URL imports, JSON-LD parsing, schema.org/Recipe adapters — owned by 004.
- Public profile pages, `@handle` routing — owned by 012.
- Video lessons, course enrollment — owned by 013.
- Subscription gating of digitization features — owned by 010.
- Automatic nutrition data fill — requires 003 integration; deferred.
- AI-assisted recipe cleanup or ingredient normalisation — requires 005; deferred.

## Users

### Primary Persona

**P10 Sage (Heritage Archivist)** — digitises a lifetime of paper recipes; values accuracy over speed; will tolerate a correction step if the app does the heavy lifting.
Key need: reliable OCR on printed + handwritten text + side-by-side correction UI + private family Circle.

### Secondary Personas

- **P3 Riley (Family Meal Planner)** — receives Circle invitations; one-tap accept; browses the family archive to plan meals (consumed by 006).
- **P8 Alex (Commise Power User)** — bulk-imports professional cookbook chapters; uses Circles for kitchen/catering team sharing; demands API reliability under load.

## User Stories

> Full user journey flows: see [product-spec/product-spec.md § User Stories / Epics](./product-spec/product-spec.md)

### Must Have (MVP)

- [ ] **US-001 (P0) — Photo Import of a Recipe Card.** As Sage, I photograph a printed recipe card; the app uploads, runs OCR, and presents a correction screen.
    - **AC:** Uploading a clear photo of a printed recipe card produces a non-empty `title`, ≥ 1 ingredient, ≥ 1 step. Correction screen renders the original image and all parsed fields as editable inputs.
- [ ] **US-002 (P0) — Side-by-side Correction.** As Sage, I review and correct the parsed output side-by-side with the original photo before saving.
    - **AC:** Original photo and parsed fields are visible simultaneously without toggling. Each field is individually editable inline; edits submit via `PATCH /api/v1/recipes/digitize/jobs/:id/correction`.
- [ ] **US-003 (P1) — Create a Circle and Invite Family.** As Sage, I create a named Circle, share its invite link, and watch invited members appear after they tap join.
    - **AC:** Create a Circle, retrieve its single active invitation link, share it with a second user, that user taps join and is added, and a recipe shared to the Circle is readable by them. A third user who never received the link cannot see the recipe. Owner can rotate the link, after which the previous link returns 410 (FR-031, FR-032, C-001).
- [ ] **US-004 (P1) — One-tap Invitation Acceptance.** As Riley, I open a Circle invite link and join with one tap, then immediately browse shared recipes.
    - **AC:** Joining via the invite link is completable using only a screen reader and keyboard on web and mobile (NFR-004). Repeated taps on the same link are idempotent (no duplicate membership). After join, the Circle's recipe list is browsable.
- [ ] **US-005 — Share a Recipe to Circles.** As Sage, I share a saved recipe to one or more of my Circles.
    - **AC:** Audience picker lists `Private` + every Circle the user belongs to. Selecting one or more Circles attaches `audience: { scope: 'circle', ref_id: <circle_id> }` to the recipe.
- [ ] **US-006 — Member Read-Only Access.** As a Circle member, I can view recipes shared to my Circle but cannot edit them unless the owner grants permission.
    - **AC:** Member tries to PATCH a Circle-shared recipe → 403. Owner can grant edit explicitly (out-of-scope hook left for future).

### Should Have

- [ ] **US-007 (P2) — Bulk Import from a Cookbook.** As Sage, I queue multiple photos and work through corrections one at a time.
    - **AC:** Uploading 3 photos in a session creates 3 separate jobs (linked by `batch_id`). Each can be corrected/saved independently. Queue surfaces remaining count.
- [ ] **US-008 — Low-confidence Token Highlighting.** As Sage, I see which tokens the OCR flagged as low-confidence so I know where to focus.
    - **AC:** Low-confidence tokens are visually distinguished by colour **and** an icon/label (NFR-004 / FR-025). Tap to edit inline.
- [ ] **US-009 — Accept-All for Clean Scans.** As Sage, I tap "Accept all" when the OCR result looks clean.
    - **AC:** "Accept all" is enabled only when no low-confidence tokens are present; tapping it commits the parsed output unchanged.
- [ ] **US-010 — Remove Circle Members.** As Alex, I remove a member from a Circle I own.
    - **AC:** `DELETE /api/v1/circles/:id/members/:userId` succeeds for the owner; non-owners get 403; the removed member loses read access on their next request.
- [ ] **US-011 — Rename a Circle.** As Alex, I rename a Circle I own.
    - **AC:** `PATCH /api/v1/circles/:id { name }` succeeds for owner only; the new name appears for all members.

### Could Have (Future)

- Automatic recipe tagging from digitised content (deferred — needs 005).
- Nutrition auto-fill from digitised ingredients (deferred — needs 003).
- Public sharing of digitised recipes via `@handle` (deferred — needs 012).

## Technical Context

> Detailed analysis: [research.md § Codebase Analysis / Tech Stack](./research.md)

### Integration Points

- **Auth (002)** — every endpoint validates an Auth0 bearer token; `user_id` derived from `sub`.
- **Recipe entity (001)** — `POST …/jobs/:id/save` writes a new `Recipe` row (owned by 001) and stores `recipe_id` on the job.
- **Sibling 004** — coordinate save semantics; 004 owns the structured/URL path; 011 owns the photo path.
- **Future 010** — optional entitlement check on enqueue (Q-002, deferred).

### Reusable Components

- S3 + CloudFront infra and pre-signed URL helpers from 001.
- Drizzle ORM + `pg` (node-postgres) conventions from 001.
- `@nestjs/config` Zod env loader and `class-validator` DTO patterns from 001.
- SQS queue+DLQ pattern from 001's version-archive queue.
- `@sentry/aws-serverless` + `@aws-lambda-powertools/logger` from 002 Lambdas.

### New Modules Required

| Package                         | Group        | Purpose                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@kitchensink/digitization-ocr` | digitization | Lambda — receives S3 key, runs Textract OCR + handwriting, returns structured JSON.                |
| `@kitchensink/digitization-api` | digitization | NestJS module — `DigitizationJob` CRUD, pre-signed URL minting, correction save.                   |
| `@kitchensink/circles-api`      | circles      | NestJS module — `Circle` entity, members, invitations, audience resolution.                        |
| `@kitchensink/shared-audience`  | shared       | Shared lib — exports `AudienceScope` enum + `Audience` shape (S-004). Imported by 001 / 006 / 007. |

### Data Model Impact

New tables (PostgreSQL 16, Drizzle): `circles`, `circle_members` (PK = `circle_id, user_id`), `circle_invitations`, `digitization_jobs`. S3 layout: `digitization/{user_id}/{job_id}/original.{ext}` (separate prefix from 001's `recipes/{recipe_id}/...`).

### Tech Stack Notes

- Node 24.x runtime (S-003) including the OCR Lambda.
- NestJS 11; paths under `/api/v1/*` (S-001).
- Drizzle ORM + `pg`; Sharp not required here (no image transformation; Textract takes the raw upload).
- AWS Textract default OCR provider; Q-001 (provider tradeoff) deferred to implementation.
- SQS for async OCR; DLQ + visibility timeout owned by ops (Q-009 deferred).

### Codebase Constraints

| Constraint                                                      | Source         | Impact                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pre-signed S3 PUT for binary; API never proxies binary.         | NFR-002, S-002 | API just mints the URL; client uploads direct to S3, then notifies via job ID.       |
| `/api/v1/*` route prefix enforced.                              | S-001          | All new endpoints scoped under `/api/v1/recipes/digitize/*` and `/api/v1/circles/*`. |
| `@kitchensink/{group}-{name}` package naming.                   | S-002          | New packages must follow naming.                                                     |
| Audit logging required for membership changes.                  | NFR-003, S-004 | `circles-api` emits structured events on every membership-state change.              |
| `audience` field uses `{ scope, ref_id?, price_cents? }` shape. | S-004          | `circle` scope ⇒ `ref_id = Circle.id`; defined in `@kitchensink/shared-audience`.    |

## Consumer Contract

> Included because **FEATURE_TYPE = shared_infrastructure**. 011 owns `Circle`, the `circle` audience scope, and `@kitchensink/shared-audience` — consumed by 001 / 006 / 007.

### Public API

```typescript
// @kitchensink/circles-api — public surface for downstream features
export interface CirclesService {
    // Resolve audience for a shareable entity. 001/006/007 use this when listing
    // resources scoped to `circle` audience.
    listCirclesForUser(userId: string): Promise<Circle[]>;
    isMember(circleId: string, userId: string): Promise<boolean>;
    resolveAudience(audience: Audience, viewerUserId: string): Promise<{ allowed: boolean; reason?: string }>;
}

// @kitchensink/shared-audience — type-only export consumed by 001/006/007
export enum AudienceScope {
    Private = 'private',
    Circle = 'circle',
    PublicProfile = 'public-profile',
    PublishedLesson = 'published-lesson',
}
export interface Audience {
    scope: AudienceScope;
    ref_id?: string;
    price_cents?: number;
}
```

### Consumer Utilities

| Utility                             | Purpose                                                                                                            | Usage                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AudienceGuard` (NestJS guard)      | Enforces `audience` access on a controller route.                                                                  | `@UseGuards(AudienceGuard)` on any handler returning a shareable entity. |
| `audienceQueryFilter(viewerUserId)` | Returns a Drizzle `where` clause that filters resources to those visible to `viewerUserId` across all four scopes. | `db.select().from(recipes).where(audienceQueryFilter(userId))`           |

### Fallback Behaviour

| Failure Mode                           | What Consumers Receive                                                                                                                                                    | Consumer Action Required                                                                                                                                 |

| Circle deleted (FR-033, C-002)         | All matching recipes are rewritten to `audience: { scope: 'private' }` synchronously with the deletion; consumers reading by `audience` see them as private to the owner. | No special handling; resource appears Private to the owner and 404 to all others. Audit events `circle.deleted` + `recipe.audience.changed` are emitted. |
| Owner account deleted (FR-035, C-004)  | Oldest non-owner member is promoted to owner; if none, Circle is soft-deleted (see row above).                                                                            | Consumers continue to call `resolveAudience`; new `Circle.owner_id` is reflected immediately.                                                            |

### Integration Pattern

```typescript
// Consumer (e.g. 001 recipe read):
const audience: Audience = recipe.audience;
const decision = await this.circlesService.resolveAudience(audience, viewerUserId);
if (!decision.allowed) throw new ForbiddenException({ error_code: 'circle.access.denied', detail: decision.reason });
return recipe;
```

## Acceptance Criteria

The feature is complete when:

1. All Must Have user stories (US-001, US-002, US-003, US-004, US-005, US-006) are implemented and pass their independent tests.
2. The four new packages exist, follow `@kitchensink/{group}-{name}` naming, and 001 imports `@kitchensink/shared-audience` + `@kitchensink/circles-api` for `circle` audience resolution.
3. NFR-001 (OCR p95 ≤ 10 s) and NFR-006 (queue health) verified via CloudWatch dashboards.
4. NFR-004 (WCAG 2.1 AA) passes axe-core in CI with 0 critical/serious violations + a manual VoiceOver/TalkBack pass on the correction + Circle invite flows (Q-007 protocol deferred to test-plan).
5. Audit logging on Circle membership changes verified by integration test (NFR-003).
6. Consumer Contract validated by a smoke test from 001 calling `circlesService.resolveAudience` against a seeded Circle.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Handwriting OCR accuracy on aged paper falls below SC-001 threshold | High — kills heritage-archivist value prop                   | Q-003 sets ship threshold at test-plan time; provider trade-off (Q-001) explored before FR-006 implementation; correction UX absorbs marginal cases.                |
| Textract cost per job exceeds budget at scale                       | Medium — financial                                           | Per-user job cap (Q-002) routed through 010 entitlement once available; cost dashboard + per-user budget alarm.                                                     |
| `Circle` schema regret blocks 001 / 006 / 007                       | High — cross-feature blast radius                            | `@kitchensink/shared-audience` versioned independently; Consumer Contract above pins the public surface; integration test from 001 in CI.                           |
| SQS DLQ build-up during incident                                    | Medium — silent failure                                      | NFR-006 alarms at any DLQ message; runbook owned by ops (Q-009 deferred).                                                                                           |
| Accessibility regressions on the correction screen                  | High — NFR-004 hard requirement                              | axe-core in CI; manual VoiceOver/TalkBack pass before each release (Q-007 protocol).                                                                                |
| Photo retention policy disputes                                     | Medium — legal/storage cost                                  | FR-022 default 30 d for discarded jobs; Q-005 (saved-job retention) resolved by Operations + Legal at implementation.                                               |
| Reusable invitation link leaks (C-001 / FR-031)                     | Medium — unauthorised join                                   | Token must be ≥ 128 bits of entropy, opaque, served over HTTPS only; rotation invalidates leaked token; rate-limit `POST /circles/join/:token` per IP and per user. |
| Unbounded Circle / member growth (C-003 / FR-034)                   | Medium — cost + UX degradation                               | NFR-007 outlier alarm; ops review on alarm; introduce hard caps in a follow-up if abuse signals appear.                                                             |
| Owner-deletion ownership transfer race (C-004 / FR-035)             | Low — wrong owner promoted under concurrent membership churn | Promotion runs in the same DB transaction as account-deletion finalisation in 002; idempotent on retry.                                                             |

## Wireframes Reference

> Visual wireframes were not produced in the bootstrap pass; `product-spec/wireframes*` is intentionally absent. UX flows are documented as described screens in [research.md § UX Patterns](./research.md).

Key screens (described, not drawn):

- **Recipe library — "Import from photo" entry point** — single tap launches camera/picker.
- **Correction screen** — split layout (left: pinch-to-zoom photo; right: editable parsed fields with low-confidence highlights).
- **Bulk queue tray** — top-right queue icon with pending count; auto-advances on save.
- **Circles tab** — list of owned + joined Circles; "New Circle" action; per-Circle member list with rename + invite + remove.
- **Audience picker** — `Private` / each named Circle / (future) `Public Profile`.

A wireframes pass is recommended as part of `pre-impl-review` if visual fidelity becomes a risk.
