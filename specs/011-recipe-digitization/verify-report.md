| ----------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| code ↔ tasks            | ⚠️ EXPECTED-GAP | `implement` phase is `not-started`; 0/100 checklist tasks marked complete; code evidence found for only 2/100 checklist tasks (`T001`, `T006`) |
| tasks ↔ plan            | ✅ PASS         | `tasks.md` now exposes every declared task ID `T001`–`T100` as exactly one executable checklist task (`- [ ] **TNNN** ...`)                    |
| plan ↔ spec.md          | ⚠️ WARNING      | `spec.md` has 33 FR IDs; `plan.md` references 23 FR IDs; 10 spec FR IDs are not explicitly cited by plan                                       |
| spec.md ↔ product-spec  | ✅ PASS         | Story set aligned (`US-001`–`US-011` in both); Must Have chain preserved (`US-001`–`US-006`)                                                   |
| product-spec ↔ research | ✅ PASS         | Problem, personas (P10/P3/P8), OCR+correction differentiator, and private Circle model are consistent                                          |

**Finding counts**

| Severity    | Count |
| ----------- | ----: |
| ❌ CRITICAL |     0 |
| ⚠️ WARNING  |     3 |
| ✅ PASSED   |     6 |

**Overall verdict**: **CONDITIONAL PASS WITH WARNINGS**. Product/document layers are largely coherent. The prior task-structure critical has been resolved; implementation remains not started, and planning citation gaps remain warnings until remediated.

## Resolved Critical Findings

### C-001: `tasks.md` checklist structure is incomplete relative to declared task space (`T001`–`T100`)

- **Where**: `specs/011-recipe-digitization/tasks.md`
- **Evidence**:
    - Declared task ID space is continuous `T001`–`T100` (including Phase 13 addendum and coverage maps).
    - Only **57** tasks appear as executable checklist entries (`- [ ] **TNNN** ...`).
    - **43 task IDs** are referenced but not represented as checklist items:
      `T002, T003, T004, T005, T007, T009, T010, T011, T012, T017, T020, T021, T022, T024, T028, T032, T035, T039, T040, T043, T045, T046, T050, T052, T054, T055, T058, T060, T061, T063, T065, T069, T070, T072, T075, T076, T078, T079, T083, T086, T087, T088, T089`.
- **Impact**: Phase execution and status accounting cannot be deterministically validated per-task across the full declared scope.
- **Required remediation**: Normalize `tasks.md` so every declared task ID in scope (`T001`–`T100`) has exactly one checklist item and one status owner.
- **Resolution (2026-05-13)**: Resolved. Parallel task labels were normalized from `**TNNN [P]**` to `**TNNN** [P]`, preserving task meaning while making every task ID machine-detectable. Verification confirms 100 checklist task IDs, no missing IDs, and no duplicates.

## WARNING Findings

### W-001: Code ↔ tasks coverage is low because implementation has not started

- **Where**: `.forge-status.yml`, `tasks.md`, repository package paths
- **Evidence**:
    - `.forge-status.yml` marks `implement.state: not-started`.
    - Checklist completion is **0/57**.
    - Verifiable file evidence exists for **2/57** checklist tasks (`T001` via `package.json`, `T006` via existing `tsconfig*.json` paths).
    - Planned implementation packages from `plan.md` are not present yet:
      `packages/api/digitization-api`, `packages/api/circles-api`, `packages/api/digitization-ocr`, `packages/shared/audience`.
- **Impact**: End-to-end implementation traceability is currently an expected pre-implementation gap, not a contradiction.

### W-002: `plan.md` does not explicitly cite all FRs present in `spec.md`

- **Where**: `specs/011-recipe-digitization/spec.md`, `specs/011-recipe-digitization/plan.md`
- **Evidence**:
    - `spec.md` cites **33** FR IDs.
    - `plan.md` cites **23** FR IDs.
    - FR IDs present in `spec.md` but not explicitly referenced in `plan.md`:
      `FR-002, FR-003, FR-004, FR-007, FR-008, FR-011, FR-016, FR-020, FR-024, FR-034`.
- **Impact**: Some requirement coverage is implied transitively through broader components/tasks, but explicit plan-level traceability is incomplete.

### W-003: Broken internal link in `spec.md`

- **Where**: `specs/011-recipe-digitization/spec.md`
- **Evidence**: Internal relative link target `../010-monetisation/spec.md` does not exist.
- **Impact**: Cross-feature navigability and document integrity checks fail for this reference.

## PASSED Findings

### P-001: Product-spec ↔ spec story alignment is complete

- `product-spec/product-spec.md` and `spec.md` both contain `US-001` through `US-011` (11/11 aligned).

### P-002: Must Have chain integrity is preserved end-to-end

- Must Have stories `US-001`–`US-006` are present in:
    - `product-spec/product-spec.md` (Must Have table)
    - `spec.md` (Must Have/MVP user stories)
    - `plan.md` (explicit “Must Have stories addressed” line)
    - `tasks.md` (story tags and traceability coverage tables)

### P-003: Plan FR set is fully represented in tasks traceability mappings

- All FR IDs explicitly cited by `plan.md` are present in `tasks.md` FR mapping tables (no plan-FR omissions in tasks).

### P-004: Product-spec ↔ research thematic consistency is intact

- Personas (P10 Sage, P3 Riley, P8 Alex), OCR + correction UX differentiator, and private invite-based Circle sharing are consistent across `research.md` and `product-spec/product-spec.md`.

### P-005: V-model layer is present and linked into the feature artifact set

- `v-model/` contains **20** artifacts (requirements, system/architecture/module design, tests, peer reviews, traceability matrix, release audit), supporting cross-layer verification context.
