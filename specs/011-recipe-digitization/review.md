# Review Log: Recipe Digitization & Family Circles

> Feature: `011-recipe-digitization` | Status: **APPROVED**
> Started: 2026-05-10
> Approved: 2026-05-10

**Milestone**: `M2` Moria
**Public Launch**: Beta (end of `M4`)
**Launch Plan**: [`v1-launch-plan.md`](../v1-launch-plan.md)

## Current Status: APPROVED

User explicitly authorized the full Product Forge + V-Model lifecycle and directed:

> "let's let those be decided at implementation time. We need to run the full speckit, speckit.v-model, and speckit.product-forge for feature 011 right?"

All open questions in `product-spec/product-spec.md` are therefore deferred to
implementation time (plan / tasks / pre-impl-review). The product spec is
otherwise approved as-is for downstream phases.

| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Q-001 | Which OCR provider should be the primary implementation — Textract, Google Vision, or hybrid?                          | **Defer to implementation.** Default to AWS Textract (already in stack); revisit if accuracy < SC-001.    | User directive: open questions decided at implementation time. Plan / pre-impl-review will own the provider trade-off. | v1.0                 |
| Q-002 | Should OCR be gated by subscription tier or a monthly job cap for all users?                                           | **Defer to implementation.** 011 will check an entitlement flag if 010 ships first; otherwise no gating.  | Cross-feature dependency on 010; explicit user directive to defer.                                                     | v1.0                 |
| Q-003 | Minimum acceptable handwriting recognition accuracy threshold before ship?                                             | **Defer to implementation.** Tracked in test-plan / V-Model acceptance phase.                             | Threshold tuning belongs to QA + acceptance test design, not product spec.                                             | v1.0                 |
| Q-004 | Which languages must be supported at launch and what is the roadmap?                                                   | **Defer to implementation.** Launch with Latin-script (EN, ES, FR, DE); CJK / RTL deferred.               | Provider validation is an engineering task; user directive to defer.                                                   | v1.0                 |
| Q-005 | Retention policy for S3 photo objects and `raw_ocr_json` after discard or save?                                        | **Defer to implementation.** FR-022 default (30 d for discarded) stands; saved-job retention TBD in plan. | Storage-cost / legal trade-off owned by ops + plan phase.                                                              | v1.0                 |
| Q-006 | When does 011 hand off Circle membership data to 012 creator profiles?                                                 | **Defer to implementation.** No 012 dependency at launch; integration contract postponed.                 | 012 not in flight; user directive to defer.                                                                            | v1.0                 |
| Q-007 | How will accessibility validation be certified — automated only or manual SR testing?                                  | **Defer to implementation.** Acceptance protocol defined in V-Model acceptance + test-plan.               | Concrete test protocol belongs in acceptance phase, not product spec.                                                  | v1.0                 |
| Q-008 | Should mobile (Expo) and web have full feature parity at launch?                                                       | **Defer to implementation.** Plan phase will produce a parity matrix.                                     | Scope decision driven by engineering capacity; user directive to defer.                                                | v1.0                 |
| Q-009 | What SQS queue configuration (visibility timeout, DLQ retry count, alarm thresholds) is required and who owns runbook? | **Defer to implementation.** Owned by plan / architecture-design / pre-impl-review.                       | Operational tuning belongs in architecture + ops runbook, not product spec.                                            | v1.0                 |

| 2026-05-10 | Approve product-spec v0.1 (bootstrap) as v1.0 without further edits.                 | User authorized full lifecycle; spec already grounded in cross-feature consistency report and `spec.md`. |
| 2026-05-10 | Defer all 9 open questions (Q-001 … Q-009) to downstream lifecycle phases.           | Explicit user directive: "let's let those be decided at implementation time".                            |
| 2026-05-10 | Promote `code-review` and `retrospective` phases from `not-applicable` to `pending`. | Full lifecycle authorized; both phases now in scope.                                                     |
| 2026-05-10 | V-Model track will run in parallel once `spec.md` stabilises post-bridge.            | User directive: "Run V-Model track in parallel once spec.md stabilizes post-bridge".                     |
| 2026-05-10 | `/speckit.clarify` will be inserted between `bridge` and `plan`.                     | User directive: "Insert /speckit.clarify after bridge produces refreshed spec.md, before plan".          |
