This directory contains Product Forge product specification artifacts for feature 011.

| Artifact      | File                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Spec  | [product-spec.md](./product-spec.md) | Vision, personas, story map, functional requirements, constraints, risks, and open decisions for OCR-based recipe digitization and private Family Circles. |
| User Journeys | [user-journey.md](./user-journey.md) | End-to-end flows for Sage digitizing paper recipes, Riley joining a Circle, and Alex running bulk imports.                                                 |
| Metrics       | [metrics.md](./metrics.md)           | Story-level metrics for OCR accuracy, correction efficiency, Circle activation, invite conversion, and bulk import reliability.                            |
| Wireframes    | _not generated_                      | Correction UI, Circle invite, and bulk queue screens still need visual decomposition before implementation.                                                |

## Traceability Rules Applied

1. This product layer is bootstrapped from `research.md`, `spec.md`, and `product-spec.md`; unresolved provider, entitlement, and OCR-threshold questions remain implementation-time decisions per `review.md`.
2. Metrics are product execution targets, not evidence that implementation or test execution has occurred.
3. Wireframes are explicitly absent rather than silently implied.
