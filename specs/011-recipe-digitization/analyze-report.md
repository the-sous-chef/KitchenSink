## Constitution Alignment Issues

- **CRITICAL (C1):** Test naming conventions in tasks conflict with Principle IV required patterns (`*.integration.test.ts`, `*.e2e.test.ts`).
- **CRITICAL (C2):** No explicit enforcement task for mandatory requirement-traceability block comment in every test file.
- **CRITICAL (C3):** No explicit per-PR schema isolation task despite Principle V MUST requirement.
- **CRITICAL (C4):** No explicit `generate:types`-before-test ordering enforcement task despite Principle VI MUST requirement.

## Unmapped Tasks

- No orphan implementation tasks detected in `tasks.md`; all T001–T100 include at least one bracketed reference (FR/NFR/US/C/R/A/D).

## Addendum Validation (T093–T100 vs stated conditions)

| Condition | Stated Resolution                               | Validation Result          | Notes                                                                    |

| C-A-002   | T094 workspace guard                            | Pass                       | Resolves workspace registration drift risk.                              |
| C-A-003   | T095 transactional isolation + concurrency test | Pass                       | Aligns with plan isolation section.                                      |
| C-D-001   | Code-first review decision (no task)            | Pass (documented decision) | Explicitly recorded in pre-impl review.                                  |

| C-R-001   | T098 soft-delete retention + hard-delete worker | Partial                    | Condition resolved, but introduces FR-033/FR-035 timing ambiguity (G1).  |
| C-R-002   | T099 + T100 flags/canary gates                  | Pass                       | Conditions mapped with explicit gating criteria.                         |

## Metrics

- Total Requirements: **44** (FR-001..FR-036 + NFR-001..NFR-008)
- Total Tasks: **100** (T001..T100)
- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task): **100%**
- Ambiguity Count: **2**
- Duplication Count: **2**
- Critical Issues Count: **4**

## Next Actions

- **CRITICAL issues exist**: Resolve constitution conflicts before `/speckit.implement`.
- Normalize data model and API terminology (`circle_invites` vs `circle_invitations`, FR-027 route scope).
- Clarify FR-033/FR-035 behavior under new soft-delete retention model introduced by addendum.
- Suggested commands:
    - `Run /speckit.tasks` to refine task constraints for constitution-required test naming and CI ordering gates`
    - `Run /speckit.plan` to align FR-027 and lifecycle timing semantics across spec/plan`
    - `Manually edit tasks.md to add explicit constitutional compliance tasks (per-PR schema isolation, test traceability headers, generate:types gate)`

Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top 8 issues?
