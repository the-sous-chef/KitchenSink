# Integration Test Plan: Recipe Digitization & Family Circles

**Feature Branch**: `011-recipe-digitization`
**Created**: 2026-05-10
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/011-recipe-digitization/v-model/architecture-design.md`

## Overview

This document defines the V-Model Integration Test Plan for Feature 011. It verifies module-boundary contracts across all architecture modules `ARCH-001..ARCH-047`, including cross-cutting modules `ARCH-041..ARCH-047`.

Scope focus:

- Boundary contracts (API, queue, storage, package contracts)
- Inter-module communication paths (API → DB, API → SQS, worker → adapter → persistence)
- Data flow transformations (raw photo → S3 object → OCR payload → parsed recipe)
- Sequence/order correctness for stateful workflows (digitization pipeline, invitation/circle lifecycle)

This feature is **non-regulated**. No safety-critical taxonomy is applied.

## Test ID & Technique Rules

- Test Case ID format: `ITP-{ARCH_NNN}-{SUFFIX}`
- Every architecture module has at least one `ITP-NNN-A` using **Interface Testing**
- Additional test cases use one of the mandatory ISO 29119 integration techniques:
    - **Interface Testing**
    - **Communication Path Testing**
    - **Data Flow Testing**
    - **Sequence/Order Testing**
