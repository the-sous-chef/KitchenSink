# Architecture Design: Recipe Digitization & Family Circles

**Feature Branch**: `011-recipe-digitization`
**Created**: 2026-05-10
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/011-recipe-digitization/v-model/system-design.md`

## Overview

Feature 011's architecture decomposes the 32 system components into cohesive, independently testable software modules organized by subsystem boundaries: photo-capture pipeline, OCR worker chain, correction surface, recipe save bridge, circles domain, audience/sharing surface, plus a cross-cutting platform layer (auth, errors, observability, telemetry, governance, CI). Each `ARCH-NNN` is sized for unit + integration testability; subsystems that span both API and UI surface are split into distinct modules to keep interface contracts narrow and to honor monorepo workspace boundaries (`packages/api/*`, `packages/web`, `packages/mobile`, `packages/ui`, `packages/shared/*`). Cross-cutting infrastructure (Auth, error envelope, telemetry, feature flags, governance/CI) is enumerated explicitly with `[CROSS-CUTTING]` parentage so downstream traceability surfaces them as horizontal concerns rather than feature components. All 14 `[FROZEN-PENDING-RESOLUTION]` markers from `system-design.md` are mirrored here as Design Constraints and remain unresolved at this layer.

## ID Schema

- **Architecture Module**: `ARCH-NNN` — sequential identifier for each module, never renumbered.
- **Parent System Components**: comma-separated `SYS-NNN` list per module (many-to-many).
- **Cross-Cutting Tag**: `[CROSS-CUTTING] — <rationale>` for infrastructure/utility modules not traceable to a specific SYS.
- Example: `ARCH-003` with Parent `SYS-001, SYS-009` — module serves both photo capture and correction surfaces.
- Example: `ARCH-027 [CROSS-CUTTING] — request-scoped logger shared by every NestJS handler` — infrastructure module.

## Design Constraints (from FROZEN-PENDING-RESOLUTION markers)

The 14 unresolved markers below are inherited from `requirements.md` via `system-design.md`. Architecture MUST NOT silently resolve them; affected `ARCH-NNN` rows reference the same markers in their descriptions where applicable.

| Frozen ID | Summary                                                                                                                                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I3        | Auth route-scope wording vs `/api/v1/*` versioning convention conflict — both retained, wording overlap unresolved.                                   |
| G1        | Circle deletion / owner-deletion / soft-delete retention timing semantics unresolved; transactional boundary defined, retention model is a parameter. |
| A1        | Manual OCR quality benchmark formula for canary gates undefined.                                                                                      |
| A2        | OCR p95 cold-start measurement contract preserved; precise cold-start definition open.                                                                |
| I1        | Invitation persistence terminology (`circle_invitations` vs `circle_invites`) MUST be canonicalized before implementation.                            |
| I2        | Invitation persistence naming alias retained pending canonicalization (paired with I1).                                                               |
| C1        | Test file naming convention conflict per Constitution Principle IV — governance owns enforcement once resolved.                                       |
| C2        | Requirement-traceability test header convention conflict per Constitution Principle IV — governance owns enforcement once resolved.                   |
| C3        | Per-PR schema isolation governance unresolved — CI/Infra owns guardrail once resolved.                                                                |
| C4        | `generate:types` ordering governance unresolved — CI/Infra owns ordering once resolved.                                                               |

> Note: `system-design.md` enumerates 10 distinct frozen marker IDs (I1, I2, I3, G1, A1, A2, C1, C2, C3, C4); the "14 markers" count from `requirements.md` reflects per-requirement occurrences. All 10 distinct constraint IDs are listed above and are mirrored on the relevant `ARCH-NNN` descriptions.

## Logical View — Component Breakdown (IEEE 42010 / Kruchten 4+1)

<!--
  Decomposition rules:
  - Every SYS-NNN (001..032) appears as a parent in at least one ARCH-NNN below.
  - Many-to-many is intentional; subsystems span multiple modules and shared modules span multiple subsystems.
  - Cross-cutting modules use [CROSS-CUTTING] — <rationale> instead of SYS parent.

## Process View — Dynamic Behavior (Kruchten 4+1)

This section documents the runtime interaction paths that bind the Logical View modules together. Each diagram lists ARCH-NNN modules as participants and uses `->>` for synchronous calls, `-->>` for asynchronous responses/replies, and `--)` for fire-and-forget event publication.

### Photo Capture → Pre-signed Upload → Job Intake

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Cap as ARCH-001/002 Capture UI
    participant Que as ARCH-004 Offline Queue
    participant Up as ARCH-003 Upload Client
    participant API as ARCH-005 Intake Controller
    participant Idem as ARCH-044 Idempotency Helper
    participant Val as ARCH-006 Pre-flight Validator
    participant S3 as ARCH-007 S3 Adapter

    Cap->>Que: enqueue(batch_id, photo[])
    Que->>Up: dequeue when online
    Up->>API: POST /jobs (idempotency-key, batch_id, content-type, size)
    API->>Idem: claim(key)
    API->>Val: validate(content-type, size)
    Val-->>API: ok | RFC7807 error
    API->>S3: mint pre-signed PUT URL
    API-->>Up: 201 {job_id, upload_url}
    Up->>S3: PUT bytes
    S3-->>Up: 200
```

**Concurrency Model**: Many capture clients in parallel; intake controller is stateless and horizontally scaled; uploads to S3 happen client-direct (no server-side bytes).
**Synchronization Points**: Idempotency-key claim before DB row insert; client MUST receive 201 before initiating S3 PUT.

### OCR Worker Dispatch → Provider Call → Parse → Persist

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Disp as ARCH-008 OCR Dispatcher
    participant SQS as SQS Topic
    participant Wrk as ARCH-009 OCR Worker Lambda
    participant Iface as ARCH-010 OcrProvider Interface
    participant Adp as ARCH-011 Provider Adapter
    participant Par as ARCH-012 Parser/Normalizer
    participant Per as ARCH-013 Payload Persistence
    participant Out as ARCH-045 Outbox Publisher
    participant OTel as ARCH-046 OTel Tracer

    Disp->>SQS: SendMessage(job_id)
    SQS->>Wrk: Receive (visibility=300s)
    Wrk->>OTel: start span(job_id)
    Wrk->>Iface: ocr(image_ref)
    Iface->>Adp: invoke vendor SDK
    Adp-->>Iface: raw_ocr_json
    Iface-->>Wrk: raw_ocr_json
    Wrk->>Par: parse(raw_ocr_json)
    Par-->>Wrk: parsed_json + per-token confidence
    Wrk->>Per: persist(raw_ocr_json, parsed_json)
    Per--)Out: emit(job.parsed)
    Wrk-->>SQS: DeleteMessage
```

**Concurrency Model**: SQS fan-out to Lambda with reserved concurrency; ≥20 concurrent jobs/user supported; one message per job, at-least-once delivery.
**Synchronization Points**: Persistence write MUST commit before message delete; outbox emission is co-transactional with persistence row.

### Correction Flow: GET correction → user edits → PATCH → Save Recipe

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as ARCH-016/017 Correction UI
    participant Corr as ARCH-014 Correction Controller
    participant Eval as ARCH-015 Accept-All Evaluator
    participant Save as ARCH-018 Save Bridge
    participant DB as ARCH-047 Drizzle Context

    UI->>Corr: GET /jobs/:id/correction
    Corr->>DB: select parsed_json + confidence
    DB-->>Corr: payload
    Corr->>Eval: evaluate(payload)
    Eval-->>Corr: accept_all_eligible: bool
    Corr-->>UI: 200 {fields, confidence, accept_all_eligible}
    UI->>Corr: PATCH /jobs/:id/correction (edits)
    Corr->>DB: update parsed_json, state=awaiting-correction
    UI->>Save: POST /jobs/:id/save
    Save->>DB: BEGIN; insert recipe; update job recipe_id, state=saved; COMMIT
    Save-->>UI: 201 {recipe_id}
```

**Concurrency Model**: Single-user-per-job edit session; optimistic concurrency via row version on `digitization_jobs`; recipe creation is per-request transactional.
**Synchronization Points**: PATCH MUST precede save; save transaction commits recipe + job linkage atomically.

### Failure / Retry / DLQ Path

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SQS as SQS Topic
    participant Wrk as ARCH-009 OCR Worker
    participant Auth as ARCH-027 Auth Guard
    participant Sentry as ARCH-043 Sentry Adapter
    participant Out as ARCH-045 Outbox Publisher
    participant DLQ as SQS DLQ

    SQS->>Wrk: Receive (attempt N)
    Wrk->>Auth: validate worker context (where applicable)
    Wrk->>Wrk: invoke provider
    Wrk--xWrk: provider error / timeout
    Wrk->>Sentry: captureException(err, job_id, attempt)
    Wrk-->>SQS: do NOT delete (visibility timeout expires)
    SQS->>Wrk: redeliver (attempt N+1)
    Note over SQS,Wrk: After maxReceiveCount, message moves to DLQ
    SQS->>DLQ: ship message
    DLQ--)Out: emit(job.failed.dlq) via watcher
```

**Concurrency Model**: At-least-once SQS redelivery with exponential backoff; DLQ alarms wired through observability pipeline (ARCH-034).
**Synchronization Points**: Sentry capture happens before message-visibility expiry; DLQ event is emitted by a separate watcher after redrive cap.

### Circle Share / Invite Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Owner as Owner Client
    participant Auth as ARCH-027 Auth Guard
    participant Inv as ARCH-026 Invitation Service
    participant Circ as ARCH-021 Circle Domain Service
    participant Aud as ARCH-024 Membership Audit Logger
    participant Invitee as Invitee Client
    participant Acc as ARCH-032 Acceptance UI
    participant Out as ARCH-045 Outbox Publisher

    Owner->>Auth: bearer token
    Auth-->>Owner: ok
    Owner->>Inv: POST /circles/:id/invitation/rotate
    Inv->>Circ: assertOwner(circle_id, user_id)
    Inv->>Inv: revoke prior token; mint new token
    Inv--)Out: emit(circle.invitation.revoked) for prior
    Inv-->>Owner: 200 {invite_url}
    Invitee->>Acc: open invite_url
    Acc->>Inv: POST /circles/join/:token
    Inv->>Circ: addMember(circle_id, user_id)  [idempotent]
    Circ->>Aud: log(actor, circle, target, action=join)
    Inv-->>Acc: 200 {circle_id}
```

**Concurrency Model**: Exactly one active invitation token per Circle (DB unique index); join is idempotent on (circle_id, user_id).
**Synchronization Points**: Token rotation revokes prior atomically with mint; rotated tokens return HTTP 410 `circle.invitation.revoked`.

### Soft-delete + 30-Day Archival Sweep

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Owner as Owner Client
    participant Circ as ARCH-021 Circle Domain Service
    participant Iso as ARCH-039 Tx Isolation Enforcer
    participant Rew as ARCH-022 Audience Rewriter
    participant Aud as ARCH-024 Audit Logger
    participant Out as ARCH-045 Outbox Publisher
    participant Sweep as ARCH-023 Soft-Delete Worker

    Owner->>Circ: DELETE /circles/:id
    Circ->>Iso: BEGIN SERIALIZABLE
    Circ->>Rew: rewriteAudiencesToPrivate(circle_id)
    Rew-->>Circ: affected_recipe_ids[]
    Circ->>Circ: mark circle soft-deleted (deleted_at=now)
    Circ->>Aud: log(circle.soft_deleted)
    Circ--)Out: emit(circle.deleted) + per-recipe(recipe.audience.changed)
    Circ-->>Owner: 204
    Note over Sweep: Daily job
    Sweep->>Sweep: select where deleted_at < now-30d
    Sweep->>Iso: BEGIN SERIALIZABLE
    Sweep->>Sweep: hard-delete circle + members + invitations
    Sweep--)Out: emit(circle.purged)
```

**Concurrency Model**: Soft-delete and sweep both run under SERIALIZABLE isolation per ARCH-039; sweep is single-instance scheduled (not fanned out).
**Synchronization Points**: Audience rewrite, soft-delete mark, audit log, and outbox emission share one transaction; sweep hard-delete shares one transaction with outbox emission.

### Concurrency & Threading Summary

- **Lambda fan-out**: OCR worker (ARCH-009) scales horizontally via SQS reserved concurrency; per-user concurrency target is ≥20 jobs without head-of-line blocking.
- **SQS visibility & at-least-once**: Workers MUST be idempotent on `job_id`; visibility timeout is sized > p99 OCR latency; DLQ catches messages exceeding `maxReceiveCount`.
- **Idempotency keys**: ARCH-044 protects retry-prone POSTs (job intake, save, invitation rotate/redeem) so client retries are safe regardless of network partition.
- **Transactional outbox**: ARCH-045 co-commits domain events with their writes (Circle delete cascade, raw-OCR purge counts, invitation revocation, recipe audience change), eliminating dual-write inconsistency.
- **Critical-path isolation**: Circle deletion and owner-deletion paths run under SERIALIZABLE (or REPEATABLE READ + `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) per ARCH-039 to preserve the audience-rewrite invariant.
- **Tracing & error capture**: ARCH-046 propagates trace context across API → SQS → Lambda → DB; ARCH-043 captures unhandled exceptions in every runtime so retries and DLQ moves are observable end-to-end.

## Interface View — API Contracts (Kruchten 4+1)

This section enumerates the input/output/exception contract for each ARCH module in the range ARCH-001..ARCH-024. Contracts use NestJS DTO conventions, Drizzle entity names from `packages/api/src/schema/*`, S3 object keys, SQS message shapes, REST routes prefixed `/api/v1/*`, and RFC 7807 `application/problem+json` for error envelopes. Frozen markers from `system-design.md` are echoed inline where they affect contract surface.

## Coverage Summary

Forward coverage: every `SYS-NNN` in `system-design.md` (SYS-001..SYS-032) is realized by at least one `ARCH-NNN` module below. Reverse coverage: every non-cross-cutting `ARCH` module (ARCH-001..ARCH-040) traces to ≥1 SYS parent; cross-cutting infrastructure (ARCH-041..ARCH-047) is enumerated separately.

| **Total ARCH modules: 47, Cross-cutting: 7, Derived: 0** | ARCH-041..ARCH-047 are `[CROSS-CUTTING]` infrastructure (logger, config/secrets, Sentry, idempotency, outbox, OpenTelemetry, Drizzle persistence). |

Coverage check: 32/32 SYS rows populated (no `MISSING` entries); 47 ARCH modules total; 7 cross-cutting; 0 derived (untraceable) modules.

## Derived Modules

None — all 47 ARCH modules are traceable to SYS-NNN parents or tagged `[CROSS-CUTTING]` with explicit rationale. No module was introduced without either a SYS parent or a documented horizontal-concern justification, so the derived-module set is empty at this layer. If a future change introduces a module that fits neither category, it MUST be enumerated here and reconciled either by lifting a new SYS into `system-design.md` or by tagging it `[CROSS-CUTTING]`.

## Glossary

| Term                      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ARCH                      | Architecture module identifier (`ARCH-NNN`); one row in the Logical View, sized for unit/integration testability.                                                                                                                      |
| SYS                       | System component identifier (`SYS-NNN`) from `system-design.md`; the parent layer above ARCH.                                                                                                                                          |
| REQ                       | Functional/non-functional requirement identifier (`REQ-NNN`) from `requirements.md`; the parent layer above SYS.                                                                                                                       |
| Cross-cutting             | Module tagged `[CROSS-CUTTING]` because it provides horizontal infrastructure (logging, config, tracing, persistence, etc.) consumed by many SYS-aligned modules without being owned by any single one.                                |
| Outbox                    | Transactional event-publication pattern (ARCH-045): events are inserted into an `outbox` table inside the same DB transaction as the state change, then drained asynchronously to ensure exactly-one publication per committed change. |
| Idempotency Key           | Client-supplied or server-derived key (ARCH-044) that lets a mutating request be safely retried without producing duplicate side effects; backed by the `idempotency_keys` table.                                                      |
| Pre-signed URL            | Time-bounded, signed S3 URL minted by the API (ARCH-005 / ARCH-007) so clients can PUT photo bytes directly to S3 without proxying through the application server.                                                                     |
| RFC 7807                  | The `application/problem+json` error response envelope (ARCH-028); every 4xx/5xx response uses this shape with a stable `error_code`.                                                                                                  |
| DLQ                       | Dead-letter queue for SQS messages that exceed retry budgets (ARCH-009, ARCH-023, ARCH-045); paired with ARCH-034 alarms.                                                                                                              |
| OcrProvider               | Provider-agnostic TS interface (ARCH-010) defining the OCR contract (input shape, confidences, language code, error taxonomy, timeout) so concrete vendor adapters (ARCH-011) can be swapped without touching the worker runtime.      |
| Side-by-side correction   | UI pattern (ARCH-016 / ARCH-017) showing the source photo alongside the parsed fields so users can correct OCR output in context before saving.                                                                                        |
| Accept-all eligibility    | Server-side rule (ARCH-015) that determines when a job's parsed fields are sufficiently complete to allow a one-click "accept all" save.                                                                                               |
| Audience                  | Typed sharing scope (`@kitchensink/shared-audience`, ARCH-029) describing who can see a recipe: `private`, `circle` (with `ref_id`), `public-profile`, or `published-lesson`.                                                          |
| Soft-delete               | Logical deletion (ARCH-022) that sets `deleted_at` rather than removing the row; combined with version-archive (ARCH-023) and a 30-day retention window.                                                                               |
| Version archive           | S3-based snapshot of a soft-deleted recipe (ARCH-023) written to `s3://recipes/<user_id>/archive/<recipe_id>/<version_id>.json`, durable beyond the live row's lifetime.                                                               |
| FROZEN-PENDING-RESOLUTION | Marker (e.g. `[FROZEN-PENDING-RESOLUTION: I3]`) inherited from `system-design.md` for design questions deferred to implementation; architecture preserves them without resolving.                                                      |
