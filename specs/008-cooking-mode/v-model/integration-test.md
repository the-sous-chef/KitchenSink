# Integration Test Plan: Cooking Mode

**Feature Branch**: `008-cooking-mode`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/008-cooking-mode/v-model/architecture-design.md`

## Overview

This document defines the Integration Test Plan for Cooking Mode. Every architecture module
in `architecture-design.md` has one or more Test Cases (ITP), and every Test Case has one or
more executable Integration Scenarios (ITS) in module-boundary BDD format (Given/When/Then).

Integration tests verify **seams and handshakes between modules**, not internal logic or user
journeys. Language must be module-boundary-oriented.

## ID Schema

- **Integration Test Case**: `ITP-{NNN}-{X}` — where NNN matches the parent ARCH, X is a letter suffix (A, B, C...)
- **Integration Test Scenario**: `ITS-{NNN}-{X}{#}` — nested under the parent ITP, with numeric suffix (1, 2, 3...)
- Example: `ITS-001-A1` → Scenario 1 of Test Case A verifying ARCH-001

## ISO 29119-4 Integration Test Techniques

Consumer-Driven Contract Testing (CDCT) is included for externally consumed module contracts; provider modules publish contracts and consumer modules validate expectations before integration deployment.

Each test case MUST identify its technique by name and anchor to a specific architecture view:

| Technique                                | Source View                   | What It Tests                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interface Contract Testing**           | Interface View                | Module API contracts, data format compliance, error responses |
| **Data Flow Testing**                    | Data Flow View                | End-to-end data transformation chain validation               |
| **Interface Fault Injection**            | Interface View + Process View | Malformed payloads, timeouts, graceful failure                |
| **Concurrency & Race Condition Testing** | Process View                  | Simultaneous access, lock handling, queue ordering            |

- **Technique**: Interface Contract Testing
- **Architecture View**: Interface View (External-Facing Module Interfaces)
- **Modules Under Test**: ARCH-001 ↔ ARCH-012
- **Preconditions**: Auth0 session context is injectable; `CookingModeScreen` receives `recipeId: string` prop.

##### ITS-001-A1 — Authenticated session propagates userId to screen lifecycle

```
Given ARCH-012 AuthGuard.checkSession() returns { userId: "user-123" }
When ARCH-001 CookingModeScreen receives { recipeId: "recipe-abc" } and calls AuthGuard
Then ARCH-001 proceeds to call ARCH-011 RecipeDataAdapter.adapt("recipe-abc")
And ARCH-001 does NOT redirect to the login screen
```

##### ITS-001-A2 — Unauthenticated session triggers redirect at the ARCH-001/ARCH-012 boundary

```
Given ARCH-012 AuthGuard.checkSession() throws AuthError
When ARCH-001 CookingModeScreen receives { recipeId: "recipe-abc" } and calls AuthGuard
Then ARCH-001 does NOT call ARCH-011 RecipeDataAdapter
And ARCH-001 emits a navigation event to the login screen
```

#### ITP-001-B: CookingModeScreen → ScreenWakeLockManager acquire/release contract (Interface Contract Testing)

- **Technique**: Interface Contract Testing
- **Architecture View**: Interface View (External-Facing Module Interfaces)
- **Modules Under Test**: ARCH-001 ↔ ARCH-009

##### ITS-001-B1 — Wake lock acquired on Cooking Mode entry

```
Given ARCH-009 ScreenWakeLockManager.acquire() is available
When ARCH-001 CookingModeScreen mounts successfully after auth and recipe load
Then ARCH-001 calls ARCH-009 acquire() exactly once
And ARCH-009 returns void without error
```

##### ITS-001-B2 — Wake lock released on Cooking Mode exit

```
Given ARCH-009 ScreenWakeLockManager holds an active wake lock
When ARCH-001 CookingModeScreen unmounts (user exits Cooking Mode)
Then ARCH-001 calls ARCH-009 release() exactly once
And ARCH-009 returns void without error
```

#### ITP-001-C: CookingModeScreen orchestration data flow (Data Flow Testing)

- **Technique**: Data Flow Testing
- **Architecture View**: Data Flow View
- **Modules Under Test**: ARCH-001 → ARCH-012 → ARCH-011 → ARCH-010 → ARCH-004
- **Preconditions**: All downstream modules are injectable stubs.

##### ITS-001-C1 — Full entry data flow: recipeId flows through auth → adapter → cache → navigation controller

```
Given ARCH-012 returns { userId: "u1" }, ARCH-011 returns CookingStep[3], ARCH-010 caches successfully
When ARCH-001 receives { recipeId: "r1" } and executes the entry sequence
Then ARCH-001 passes "r1" to ARCH-011.adapt()
And ARCH-001 passes the returned CookingStep[3] to ARCH-010.cacheRecipe()
And ARCH-001 passes totalSteps=3 to ARCH-004.initialise()

```
Given ARCH-003 StepTransitionAnimator passes { step: CookingStep, stepIndex: 1, totalSteps: 5 }
When ARCH-002 StepDisplayPanel receives the props
Then ARCH-002 renders with accessible role and aria-label containing step content
And ARCH-002 does NOT throw or show a placeholder
```

##### ITS-002-A2 — Missing step data triggers placeholder at the ARCH-003/ARCH-002 boundary

```
Given ARCH-003 StepTransitionAnimator passes { step: undefined, stepIndex: 0, totalSteps: 0 }
When ARCH-002 StepDisplayPanel receives the props
Then ARCH-002 renders a placeholder UI

```
Given ARCH-003 StepTransitionAnimator's animation engine throws an error on transition
When ARCH-004 emits a stepIndex change to ARCH-003
Then ARCH-003 falls back to instant (non-animated) render
And ARCH-003 still passes correct props to ARCH-002 StepDisplayPanel
And no error propagates to ARCH-013 ErrorBoundaryAndLogger
```

Then ARCH-004 emits onStepChange({ stepIndex: 1 }) to ARCH-003 StepTransitionAnimator
And ARCH-004 emits onStepChange({ stepIndex: 1 }) to ARCH-006 TimerEngine
```

##### ITS-004-A2 — goPrev() at boundary is a no-op — no event emitted
