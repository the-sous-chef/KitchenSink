# System Design: Cooking Mode

**Feature Branch**: `008-cooking-mode`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/008-cooking-mode/v-model/requirements.md`

## Overview

Cooking Mode is decomposed into five system components: a Step Display subsystem responsible for rendering recipe instructions one step at a time, a Step Navigation module managing forward/backward traversal, a Timer Engine service handling countdown logic and audio alerts, a Screen Wake Lock utility preventing device sleep, and an Offline Cache module ensuring recipe data availability without connectivity. Cross-cutting concerns (type safety, accessibility, documentation) are addressed by a Quality & Accessibility component. The system is a read-only consumer of Recipe data from feature 001 and requires an authenticated session from feature 002.

## ID Schema

- **System Component**: `SYS-NNN` — sequential identifier for each component
- **Parent Requirements**: Comma-separated `REQ-NNN` list per component (many-to-many)
- Example: `SYS-003` with Parent Requirements `REQ-001, REQ-005` — component satisfies both requirements

## Decomposition View (IEEE 1016 §5.1)

| SYS ID  | Name                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  | Parent Requirements                                           | Type      |
| ------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| SYS-001 | Step Display            | Renders the current recipe instruction step in large, readable formatting. Manages step index state, displays step number/total, and triggers smooth visual transitions between steps.       | REQ-001, REQ-008, REQ-009, REQ-NF-003, REQ-NF-004, REQ-NF-005 | Subsystem |
| SYS-002 | Step Navigation         | Controls forward and backward traversal through recipe steps. Maintains current step index, enforces boundary conditions (first/last step), and exposes gesture/tap input handlers.          | REQ-002, REQ-003, REQ-010                                     | Module    |
| SYS-003 | Timer Engine            | Parses timed step durations from recipe data, manages countdown state (start/pause/reset), emits audible alerts on completion, and exposes timer status to the display layer.                | REQ-004, REQ-005, REQ-006                                     | Service   |
| SYS-004 | Screen Wake Lock        | Acquires the platform wake lock when Cooking Mode is entered and releases it on exit. Handles platform API differences (Web Wake Lock API / React Native `activateKeepAwake`).               | REQ-007, REQ-CN-002                                           | Utility   |
| SYS-005 | Offline Recipe Cache    | Caches the full recipe (steps, timers, instructions) into local storage when Cooking Mode is entered so that subsequent steps remain accessible without network connectivity.                | REQ-011                                                       | Module    |
| SYS-006 | Recipe Data Adapter     | Adapts the Recipe entity from feature 001-commise-recipe-app into the Cooking Mode internal step model. Read-only; never mutates Recipe data.                                              | REQ-IF-001, REQ-CN-001                                        | Adapter   |
| SYS-007 | Auth Guard              | Verifies a valid authenticated session (via feature 002-user-auth) before allowing entry into Cooking Mode. Redirects unauthenticated users to the login flow.                         | REQ-IF-002                                                    | Service   |
| SYS-008 | Quality & Accessibility | Cross-cutting: enforces TypeScript strict mode, JSDoc documentation requirements, accessible component naming, and color-independent state communication across all Cooking Mode components. | REQ-NF-001, REQ-NF-002, REQ-NF-004, REQ-NF-005                | Utility   |

## Dependency View (IEEE 1016 §5.2)

| Source  | Target  | Relationship | Failure Impact                                                                              |
| ------- | ------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SYS-001 | SYS-002 | Reads        | Step Display cannot determine which step to render; shows stale or incorrect step.          |
| SYS-001 | SYS-003 | Reads        | Step Display cannot show timer state; timer UI is absent or frozen.                         |
| SYS-001 | SYS-006 | Reads        | Step Display has no recipe data; Cooking Mode cannot render any content.                    |
| SYS-002 | SYS-006 | Reads        | Navigation cannot determine step boundaries; forward/backward may go out of range.          |
| SYS-003 | SYS-006 | Reads        | Timer Engine cannot parse step durations; no timers are started.                            |
| SYS-005 | SYS-006 | Writes       | Offline cache cannot persist recipe data; offline mode is unavailable.                      |
| SYS-006 | SYS-007 | Calls        | Recipe Adapter cannot confirm auth; Cooking Mode entry is blocked or insecure.              |
| SYS-004 | SYS-001 | Subscribes   | Wake lock is not acquired/released in sync with Cooking Mode lifecycle; battery drain risk. |

| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| CON-001       | Cooking Mode MUST NOT modify Recipe data; all access is read-only.                                                | REQ-CN-001 |
