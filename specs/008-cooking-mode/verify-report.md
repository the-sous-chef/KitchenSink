| Layer                     | Status          | Findings                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| product-spec/ ↔ research/ | ✅ PASS         | Product stories align with research constraints (wake lock, timer UX, accessibility, offline behavior)                                                                                                                          |

**Current counts**: **0 CRITICAL**, **3 WARNING**, **1 EXPECTED-GAP**.

**Overall**: ✅ PASS for the bootstrapped Product Forge layers (`research/`, `product-spec/`, root lifecycle artifacts). Implementation gap is expected and non-blocking at this stage.

---

## CRITICAL Findings

_None._

The retroactively bootstrapped artifacts are internally consistent and grounded in existing upstream sources.

---

## WARNING Findings

### W-001: Ingredient checkoff appears in task and requested wireframes but has no explicit FR in `spec.md`

- **Where**: Requested wireframe set includes `cook-ingredients-panel`; `tasks.md` references per-step ingredient display.
- **Why it's not CRITICAL**: This is additive UX scope that can remain in Product Forge as a candidate story without altering implementation constraints today.
- **Recommendation**: During revalidation, decide whether to add a new FR in `spec.md` for ingredient checkoff/panel behavior.

### W-002: Cook-time scaling is requested domain scope but not represented as FR-032..FR-035

- **Where**: User request includes cook-time scaling; current canonical FR set only includes step display/navigation/timers/wake lock.
- **Why it's not CRITICAL**: Scaling is documented as a net-new candidate in product spec; no upstream file was modified.
- **Recommendation**: If v1 requires scaling in cooking mode, add explicit FR and REQ entries in a future spec revision.

### W-003: Voice-control details are broader in research/plan than in canonical FR set

- **Where**: `research.md` and `plan.md` include voice command implementation details; `spec.md` includes voice in narrative but no dedicated FR.
- **Why it's not CRITICAL**: Voice control is currently represented as Should Have and Phase 2 in tasks.
- **Recommendation**: Keep as Should Have unless product owner promotes it and updates `spec.md`.

---

## EXPECTED-GAP Findings

### EG-001: No implementation evidence yet for task completion

- **Observation**: `tasks.md` defines 32 tasks; no completion markers and no corresponding source files exist yet for cooking mode components/services.
- **Interpretation**: Expected for a pre-implementation feature package.
- **Action**: None required for bootstrap completion.

---

## PASSED Verifications (Detail)

1. **Artifact shape parity with 001 pattern**
    - Root artifacts present: `.forge-status.yml`, `review.md`, `verify-report.md`.
    - Research folder contains 6 files.
    - Product-spec folder contains 4 files + `wireframes/` directory.

2. **Story-to-FR traceability**
    - All authored stories map to FR-032, FR-033, FR-034, FR-035 only.
    - Any net-new behavior beyond those FRs is explicitly labeled as warning/deferred, not asserted as canonical requirement.

3. **Research augmentation rule satisfied**
    - Existing `research.md` was treated as source material and split into `research/*.md` artifacts with additional structure.
    - No upstream source documents were edited.

4. **Date normalization status**
    - Existing Product Forge artifacts remain dated `2026-05-09` (bootstrap creation date); this verification run is dated `2026-05-12`.

---

## Recommendations Before Implementation

1. Run `/speckit.product-forge.revalidate` to resolve warnings W-001..W-003.
2. If ingredient checkoff or cook-time scaling are required in v1, promote to explicit FR(s) and regenerate downstream traceability.
3. Keep voice control in Phase 2 unless a hard delivery requirement is declared.

---

## Verdict

✅ **PASS** — Retroactive Product Forge bootstrap for `008-cooking-mode` remains complete, structurally aligned to the 001 pattern, and traceable to current upstream artifacts.
