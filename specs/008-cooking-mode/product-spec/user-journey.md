## Journey Notation

This document captures the primary end-to-end cooking flow and edge-case subflows. Steps reference FR IDs in brackets where canonical mapping exists.

## Persona 1: Active Home Cook — Journey A: Execute a Recipe in Cooking Mode

**Scenario**: User selects an existing recipe, enters cooking mode, progresses through steps, runs two timers, and completes the recipe without the screen sleeping.

    participant U as User (Mobile)
    participant App as Cooking Mode UI
    participant API as Recipe API (001)
    participant Store as Local Session Store
    participant Device as Device Runtime

    U->>App: Open recipe detail and tap "Start Cooking"
    App->>API: GET /v1/recipes/{id}/instructions
    API-->>App: instructions[]

    Note right of App: FR-032: one-step-at-a-time large text
    App->>U: Render Step 1 of N (large readable format)

    U->>App: Tap Next / swipe left
    Note right of App: FR-033: forward navigation
    App->>U: Render Step 2 of N

    U->>App: Tap Previous / swipe right
    Note right of App: FR-033: backward navigation without losing place
    App->>U: Render Step 1 of N

    U->>App: Start timer on timed step
    Note right of App: FR-034: integrated countdown timer
    App->>App: Countdown visible

    U->>App: Start second timer on later step
    App->>App: Two timers active concurrently

    App->>Device: Request wake lock / keep-awake
    Note right of Device: FR-035: screen remains active in mode

    App->>Store: Persist current step + active timers

    App-->>U: Timer completes (audio + visual alert)
    Note right of App: FR-034 Acceptance Scenario 3

    U->>App: Complete final step
    App->>Store: Clear active session
    App->>Device: Release wake lock
    App-->>U: Cooking completed state
```

## Edge Flow 1: Connectivity Loss Mid-Session

1. User enters cooking mode while online and recipe data loads.
2. Connectivity drops during step progression.
3. App continues local navigation/timers from loaded state.
4. User completes flow without additional network requests.

**Coverage**: Edge case in `spec.md`, REQ-011.

---

## Edge Flow 2: App Interruption and Resume Prompt

1. User leaves app while timers are active.
2. Session state is persisted with step index + timers.
3. On return (within configured window), app offers resume prompt.
4. User resumes at previous step and timer state.

**Coverage**: Plan session-resume model; mapped to US-007 (Should Have).

---

## Edge Flow 3: Voice Command Attempt (Phase 2)

1. User enables voice control.
2. App listens for bounded command grammar (`next`, `back`, `start timer`).
3. Recognized command advances or adjusts state.
4. Unrecognized input yields clear retry feedback.

**Coverage**: Should Have candidate; not a canonical standalone FR.
