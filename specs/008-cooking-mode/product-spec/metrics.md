# Metrics: Cooking Mode — Story-Level

**Branch**: `008-cooking-mode`
**Date**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: [product-spec.md](./product-spec.md), [spec.md](../spec.md), [v-model/requirements.md](../v-model/requirements.md)
**Distinction from research/metrics-roi.md**: That file covers feature-level ROI and broader adoption framing. This file is story-level with per-story measurable outcomes.

## Metric Notation

Each metric is tied to a Must Have story. Signals should be queryable via telemetry, test assertions, or deterministic QA checks.

## Signalfreeze

Story-level metrics are measured via:

- **App telemetry** for interaction and runtime state transitions.
- **E2E tests** for deterministic boundary and accessibility assertions.
- **Device-lab QA** for readability and wake-lock behavior in real hardware conditions.
