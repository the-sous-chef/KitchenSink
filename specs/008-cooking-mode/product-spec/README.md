## Index

This directory contains the Product Forge v1.3.0 product specification artifacts for the Cooking Mode feature.

| Artifact      | File                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Spec  | [product-spec.md](./product-spec.md)  | Vision, personas, epics, MoSCoW story map with FR traceability, and out-of-scope list for cooking mode scope.                                                                                             |
| User Journeys | [user-journey.md](./user-journey.md)  | End-to-end flow for active cooking, plus interruption/offline/timer edge paths. Includes Mermaid sequence diagram and coverage matrix.                                                                    |
| Wireframes    | [wireframes/](./wireframes/README.md) | ASCII conceptual wireframes for five requested key screens: cook-step, cook-timer, cook-ingredients-panel, cook-voice-control, cook-completed. Each wireframe annotates FR links and warning-scope items. |
| Metrics       | [metrics.md](./metrics.md)            | Per-story measurable outcomes for Must Have stories. Distinct from `research/metrics-roi.md` (feature-level portfolio and ROI framing).                                                                   |

## Scope Discipline

- Stories in this directory MUST trace to canonical FRs from `spec.md`.
- Requested domain additions (ingredient checkoff, cook-time scaling, expanded voice controls) are documented as candidate scope and flagged until canonical FRs are extended.
