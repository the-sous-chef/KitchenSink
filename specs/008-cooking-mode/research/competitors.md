## Competitive Landscape Overview

Cooking-mode competitors cluster into two groups:

1. **Recipe-management incumbents** (Paprika, Yummly, Kitchen Stories) with polished reading and timer UX.
2. **Assistant-led experiences** (SideChef and similar) emphasizing guided flow and voice-adjacent interaction.

The core opportunity for Sous Chef is not just “having cook mode,” but delivering a reliable **hands-busy** workflow with robust timer handling, wake lock behavior, and accessible controls that survive real kitchen conditions.

## Positioning Implications for 008

1. **Must-win basics**: Step readability, navigation reliability, timer trust, and wake-lock stability are table stakes.
2. **Execution quality differentiator**: Accessibility-first design (touch target sizing, non-color state cues, accessible labels) can be a durable advantage.
3. **Phased expansion**: Voice control, ingredient checkoff, and cook-time scaling can be introduced in controlled increments once canonical FRs are expanded.

---

## Risks to Track

- Under-delivering timer reliability instantly erodes trust in cook mode.
- Inconsistent wake-lock behavior across web/mobile would create parity failures.
- Overloading v1 with non-canonical scope (without FR updates) can break traceability discipline.
