# Competitor Analysis: Grocery Lists & Ordering Assistants

**Branch**: `007-grocery-lists` | **Date**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Complete | **Sources**: [research.md](./research.md) (RQ-1), user-specified competitor set

## Competitive Landscape Overview

Feature 007 sits between meal-planning execution and purchase execution. Competitors split into two buckets:

1. **Dedicated grocery list tools** (AnyList, Out of Milk, Bring)
2. **General-purpose task/list tools** (Apple Reminders)

None of the benchmarked tools natively combine all four target capabilities as one flow:

- meal-plan-derived auto-generation (dependency on feature 006)
- robust unit-aware ingredient aggregation
- pantry subtraction / check-off UX
- premium store API ordering handoff with product mapping

## Differentiation Thesis for 007

1. **Deterministic upstream grounding**: Lists are generated from structured meal plans (006) and recipe ingredients (001), not ad-hoc text only.
2. **Higher-fidelity aggregation path**: Shared culinary-unit conversion plus USDA-backed normalization path yields better dedupe than name-only merging.
3. **Premium checkout architecture**: Store setup + SKU mapping + order handoff is explicit in FR-030/FR-031 and plan/tasks.
4. **Store-specific execution UX**: Aisle grouping and list views can be tuned for in-store speed, not only list maintenance.

## Risk Notes

- **Sharing gap**: Collaboration/sharing is a requested domain expectation but not yet formalized as explicit FR in `spec.md`.
- **API dependency risk**: Ordering value depends on integration reliability and product mapping freshness.
- **Conversion trust risk**: Incorrect unit conversion degrades user trust quickly; quality must be measurable.
