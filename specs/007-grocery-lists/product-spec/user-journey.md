## Persona 1: Weekly Planner (Riley) — Journey A: Plan to Generated Grocery List

**Scenario**: Riley completes a 7-day meal plan and generates a grocery list, expecting deduplicated ingredients and usable quantities.

    API->>DB: Insert grocery_list + grocery_list_items
    DB-->>API: listId + items
    API-->>U: 201 Created (grouped list payload)

```

## Persona 2: Household Shopper (Sam) — Journey B: In-Store Execution with Pantry + Check-Off

## Persona 3: Premium Optimizer (Jordan) — Journey C: Store Setup and Order Handoff

**Scenario**: Jordan attempts to order groceries. The app guides setup if needed, then provides mapped-item review and checkout handoff.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Jordan (Web)
    participant API as Commise API
    participant MAP as Product Mapping Service
    participant STORE as Store API Adapter
    participant SUB as Subscription (010)

    U->>API: POST /v1/grocery-lists/{id}/order
    API->>SUB: Check premium entitlement

    alt Non-premium
        API-->>U: 403 Premium required + upgrade prompt
    else Premium but no store configured
        API-->>U: Setup required guidance
        U->>API: POST /v1/grocery-lists/store/connect
        API-->>U: Store connected
        U->>API: POST /v1/grocery-lists/{id}/order (retry)
    else Premium + store configured
        API->>MAP: Map grocery items to store products
        MAP->>STORE: Search/create cart payload
        STORE-->>MAP: Checkout link + mapping status
        API-->>U: Review payload (mapped/unmapped) + checkoutUrl
    end

    Note right of U: FR-030, FR-031
```

---

## Edge Journey: Unmapped Items During Ordering

1. User reaches pre-order review.
2. Some items are `unmapped`.
3. User keeps unmapped items as manual in-store follow-up.
4. Order handoff proceeds for mapped subset.

This preserves flow continuity without silently dropping unknown items.

**FR linkage**: FR-031.

## Journey D: Dedicated Shopping Lists Page — Create List Without a Meal Plan

**Persona**: P8 Alex — Commise Power User
**Scenario**: Alex wants to add a few items for a weekend shop without building a full meal plan. They navigate directly to the Shopping Lists page and create a standalone list.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Alex (Web or Mobile)
    participant NAV as Main Navigation
    participant API as Commise API
    participant DB as Grocery Tables

    U->>NAV: Tap "Shopping Lists" in main nav
    NAV-->>U: /shopping-lists page (all lists, paginated)

    U->>U: Tap "New List"
    U->>U: Enter list name; leave meal plan picker empty
    U->>API: POST /v1/grocery-lists { name: "Weekend shop", mealPlanId: null }
    API->>DB: Insert grocery_list (meal_plan_id = NULL)
    DB-->>API: listId
    API-->>U: 201 Created (empty list)

    U->>API: POST /v1/grocery-lists/{id}/items { displayName: "Avocados", quantity: "2" }
    API->>DB: Insert manual item
    API-->>U: Item added

    Note right of U: FR-032, SC-009
```

**Also covered**: User can alternatively pick a meal plan from the dropdown on the same "New List" form, which triggers `POST /v1/grocery-lists { mealPlanId: "mp_xyz" }` and generates a full aggregated list.

---

## Journey E: Cross-Link Navigation Between Meal Plan and Grocery List

**Persona**: P3 Riley — Family Meal Planner
**Scenario**: Riley generated a grocery list from a meal plan last week. She wants to check the meal plan again while shopping, then return to the list.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Riley (Mobile)
    participant GL as Grocery List Screen
    participant MP as Meal Plan Screen (006)

    U->>GL: Open grocery list "Week of May 12"
    GL-->>U: List items + "From meal plan: Week of May 12" chip

    U->>GL: Tap meal plan chip
    GL->>MP: Navigate to /meal-plans/{id}
    MP-->>U: Meal plan detail + "Grocery Lists" section showing "Week of May 12"

    U->>MP: Tap "Week of May 12" in Grocery Lists section
    MP->>GL: Navigate back to grocery list
    GL-->>U: List restored to previous scroll position

    Note right of U: FR-033
```

**Edge case**: If the meal plan was deleted after the list was generated, the chip shows "Meal plan no longer available" and is not tappable. The list itself is unaffected.
