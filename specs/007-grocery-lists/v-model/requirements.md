### Interface Requirements

| ID         | Description                                                                                                                                                                    | Priority | Rationale                                                                                                          | Verification Method |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| REQ-IF-001 | The system SHALL integrate with third-party grocery store APIs (e.g., Instacart, Kroger, Amazon Fresh) for online order creation; available stores MUST vary by user location. | P2       | Assumption — online ordering is implemented via third-party APIs; interface contract must be defined per provider. | Test                |
| REQ-IF-002 | The system SHALL consume ingredient data from Recipe entities as defined in the `001-sous-chef-recipe-app` specification.                                                      | P1       | Dependency — ingredient identity and quantity data originates from the Recipe domain.                              | Inspection          |
| REQ-IF-003 | The system SHALL use USDA Food Data (`003-usda-food-data`) for ingredient identity resolution, unit normalization during aggregation, deduplication.                           | P1       | Dependency — correct deduplication requires canonical ingredient identity and unit normalization.                  | Test                |
| REQ-IF-004 | The system SHALL consume meal plan data from the `006-meal-planning` feature as the source for grocery list generation.                                                        | P1       | Dependency — grocery lists are derived from meal plans; no meal plan data means no grocery list.                   | Test                |
| REQ-IF-005 | The system SHALL enforce authentication via `002-auth0-user-auth` for all grocery list, online ordering endpoints.                                                             | P1       | Dependency — all grocery features require authentication; unauthenticated access MUST be rejected.                 | Test                |
| REQ-IF-006 | Online ordering SHALL be restricted to users with an active premium subscription as defined in `010-subscriptions`.                                                            | P2       | Dependency — online ordering is a premium feature; subscription gate must be enforced at the interface layer.      | Test                |

| REQ-IF-007 | The system SHALL provide equivalent web and mobile user-facing workflows for Grocery Lists & Online Ordering, including the same core capabilities, entitlement behavior, error states, accessibility semantics, and recovery paths unless an explicit V-Model parity exception is recorded. | P1 | KitchenSink Constitution Principle VIII requires web/mobile lockstep for every user-facing capability. | Test |

### Constraint Requirements

| ID         | Description                                                                                                                                                | Priority | Rationale                                                                                | Verification Method |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| REQ-CN-001 | The feature MUST NOT be accessible without a valid Auth0 session token; all API routes MUST validate the JWT before processing any request.                | P1       | Security constraint — grocery data is user-specific and must be protected.               | Test                |
| REQ-CN-002 | Online ordering functionality MUST be gated behind the premium subscription tier; free-tier users MUST NOT be able to submit orders to grocery store APIs. | P2       | Business constraint — online ordering is a premium feature driving subscription revenue. | Test                |
| REQ-CN-003 | Grocery list generation MUST derive ingredient data exclusively from the meal plan, recipe entities; no manual ingredient entry is in scope for this spec. | P1       | Scope constraint — manual entry is not described in spec.md; prevents scope creep.       | Inspection          |

## Assumptions

- Grocery store integrations will be implemented via third-party APIs (e.g., Instacart, Kroger, Amazon Fresh); available stores will vary by user location.
- Unit normalization (e.g., "2 cups" + "500 ml" of the same ingredient) is handled by the USDA Food Data integration (`003-usda-food-data`).
- The premium subscription gate for online ordering is enforced by the `010-subscriptions` feature; this spec assumes that gate exists and is callable.
