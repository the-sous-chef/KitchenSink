# Acceptance Test Plan: Grocery Lists & Online Ordering

**Feature Branch**: `007-grocery-lists`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/007-grocery-lists/v-model/requirements.md`

---

## Overview

This document defines the Acceptance Test Plan for the Grocery Lists & Online Ordering feature. Acceptance tests verify that the system satisfies user-facing requirements from the perspective of an end user or product stakeholder. They are written in BDD format (Given/When/Then) and map directly to REQ-\* identifiers from `requirements.md`.

Acceptance tests sit at the top of the V-Model verification chain. They complement system tests (which verify architectural behavior) and unit tests (which verify module logic) by confirming that the assembled system delivers the outcomes users actually care about.

**Scope**: All P1 and P2 functional, non-functional, interface, and constraint requirements from `requirements.md`.

**Out of scope**: Internal component wiring, database schema correctness, and infrastructure provisioning. Those are covered by system and unit tests.

## ID Schema

| Identifier               | Pattern      | Meaning                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acceptance Test Case     | `AT-NNN-X`   | NNN matches the parent REQ number; X is a letter suffix (A, B, C...) for multiple cases per REQ |
| Acceptance Test Scenario | `ATS-NNN-X#` | Nested under the parent AT; numeric suffix (1, 2, 3...) for multiple scenarios per case         |

**Examples**:

- `AT-001-A` — first acceptance test case for REQ-001
- `ATS-001-A1` — first scenario within AT-001-A
- `AT-NF-003-A` — acceptance test case for REQ-NF-003
- `ATS-CN-001-A2` — second scenario within the first acceptance test case for REQ-CN-001

    - **Given** my meal plan contains two recipes that both require "chicken breast" (one calls for 200 g, the other for 300 g)
    - **When** I generate a grocery list
    - **Then** "chicken breast" appears exactly once on the list with a quantity of 500 g

- **ATS-002-A2**
    - **Given** my meal plan contains ingredients measured in different but compatible units (e.g., "2 cups milk" and "500 ml milk")
    - **When** I generate a grocery list
    - **Then** "milk" appears once with quantities normalized and summed to a canonical unit

---

#### Tier 2 — User Story: As the system, I must enforce security and scope constraints

---

##### AT-CN-001-A: All grocery API routes require a valid Auth0 JWT

**Requirement**: REQ-CN-001
**Technique**: Fault Injection
**Priority**: P1

- **ATS-CN-001-A1**
    - **Given** a request is made to any grocery list or ordering API route with an expired or missing JWT
    - **When** the server processes the request
    - **Then** the server returns HTTP 401 and no grocery data is exposed

- **ATS-CN-001-A2**
    - **Given** a request is made with a structurally valid but tampered JWT
    - **When** the server validates the token
    - **Then** the server returns HTTP 401 and logs the failed validation attempt

---

##### AT-CN-002-A: Online ordering is gated behind the premium subscription tier

**Requirement**: REQ-CN-002

## Exit Criteria

All of the following conditions must be met before the feature is considered accepted:

### Mandatory (P1 requirements)

1. **All P1 acceptance test scenarios pass** — ATS-001-A1, ATS-001-A2, ATS-002-A1, ATS-002-A2, ATS-003-A1, ATS-003-A2, ATS-004-A1, ATS-004-A2, ATS-005-A1, ATS-005-A2, ATS-009-A1, ATS-NF-003-A1, ATS-NF-004-A1, ATS-IF-005-A1, ATS-CN-001-A1, ATS-CN-001-A2 must all pass with no failures.

2. **Performance threshold met** — Grocery list generation for a 7-day plan completes within 5 seconds at p95 across at least 10 consecutive test runs.

3. **Authentication gate verified** — HTTP 401 is returned for every unauthenticated or invalid-JWT request to every grocery endpoint; no data leaks.

4. **Accessibility verified** — All interactive grocery list UI elements are reachable via `getByRole` or `getByLabel` in Playwright; no element requires a test ID or CSS selector fallback.

5. **Inspection sign-off** — A reviewer has confirmed that REQ-NF-001 (strict TypeScript), REQ-NF-002 (JSDoc), REQ-CN-003 (no manual ingredient entry), and REQ-IF-002 (Recipe entity sourcing) are satisfied in the merged code.

### Conditional (P2 requirements)

6. **P2 automated scenarios pass** — ATS-008-A1, ATS-008-A2, ATS-009-A1, ATS-010-A1, ATS-IF-006-A1, ATS-CN-002-A1 must pass before the online ordering sub-feature ships.

7. **Manual demonstrations accepted** — A product stakeholder has signed off on REQ-006 (store configuration), REQ-007 (setup guidance flow), and REQ-011 (10-minute workflow) via a recorded or live demonstration session.

### Blocking conditions
