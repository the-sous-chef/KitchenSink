## Competitive Landscape Overview

Subscription monetization in the recipe space clusters into three models:

1. **One-time purchase utility** (Paprika)
2. **Freemium conversion funnel** (Mealime, SideChef)
3. **Full-subscription planning service** (PlateJoy)

Sous Chef's proposed model (`FR-040` free tier + `FR-041` premium unlocks) sits closest to **freemium conversion** while preserving broad free utility to maximize top-of-funnel adoption.

| **Free tier**                 | None                                                                                          |

## Positioning Thesis for Feature 010

Sous Chef should position premium around **outcome acceleration**, not basic access:

- Free tier proves utility and habit formation (recipe creation, sharing, manual planning).
- Premium unlocks leverage layers (privacy controls, AI-assisted authoring/planning, commerce convenience, trainer workflows).
- Subscription lapse should feel reversible and low-risk because user data remains intact (`FR-043`).

## Risks and Considerations

1. **Family plan expectations**: Competitors increasingly offer household tiers; this feature currently has no explicit family-plan FR.
2. **Mobile billing parity**: Domain expects App Store / Play Store presence; plan currently specifies Stripe stack only.
3. **Paywall fatigue**: Overusing modal interruptions can depress trust and engagement.

These are recorded as strategy warnings, not hard requirements, until source artifacts add explicit FRs.
