## Persona 3: Returning Subscriber (Morgan) — Journey C: Payment Failure, Grace, Downgrade, Reactivation

**Scenario**: Morgan's renewal fails, enters grace period, downgrades to free behavior without data loss, then reactivates.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Stripe as Stripe
    participant Webhook as Webhook Service
    participant DB as Account Store
    participant Morgan as Morgan
    participant API as Sous Chef API

    Stripe->>Webhook: invoice.payment_failed
    Webhook->>DB: status=past_due

    Morgan->>API: Attempt premium action during grace
    API-->>Morgan: allowed/conditional based on grace policy

    Stripe->>Webhook: customer.subscription.deleted
    Webhook->>DB: plan=free, status=canceled

    Morgan->>API: Access core features and historical data
    API-->>Morgan: data retained, premium actions gated [FR-043]

    Morgan->>API: POST /v1/billing/checkout (re-upgrade)
    Stripe->>Webhook: checkout.session.completed
    Webhook->>DB: plan=premium
```

## Cross-Platform Journey D: Restore Purchase Signal (Mobile)

**Scenario**: User reinstalls app or switches device and invokes restore purchase to resync entitlement state.

1. User opens Billing Settings > Restore Purchase.
2. App calls restore/sync endpoint and refreshes account plan state.
3. App displays resolved entitlement state and available actions.

Coverage:

- Supports continuity expectations tied to `FR-043` trust contract.
- If mobile store billing is added, this flow becomes mandatory parity path (currently future-oriented warning).
