| Product Spec  | [product-spec.md](./product-spec.md)  | Vision, personas, epics, MoSCoW story map with strict traceability to `FR-040..FR-043`, and explicit out-of-scope list.                                               |
| User Journeys | [user-journey.md](./user-journey.md)  | End-to-end journeys covering free-tier usage, premium upgrade, subscription lifecycle events, cancellation/downgrade behavior, and restore-purchase flow.             |
| Wireframes    | [wireframes/](./wireframes/README.md) | ASCII conceptual wireframes for six monetization screens: pricing page, paywall modal, subscription management, billing history, restore purchase, tier upgrade flow. |
| Metrics       | [metrics.md](./metrics.md)            | Story-level measurable outcomes for subscription adoption, conversion, gating UX quality, and retention after downgrade.                                              |

## Traceability Rules Applied

1. All stories in `product-spec.md` map to `FR-040`..`FR-043` from `spec.md`.
2. Any domain request not represented in source FRs is marked as **future consideration** rather than a hard requirement.
3. Dependency-gated capabilities from other specs are referenced only as transitive behavior under `FR-041`.
