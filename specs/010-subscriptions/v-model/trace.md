**Overall coverage: 100%** (all 31 requirements have verification path)

---

## Orphan & Gap Report

### Orphans (ATP/UTS with no REQ)

**None found** — all 30 ATPs trace to at least one requirement.

### Gaps (REQ with no verification path)

**None found** — all 31 requirements have either an AT, inspection path, or demonstration justification.

### Integration Test Gaps (Priority Ordered)

| Priority | Integration Point                    | Risk                                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| P1       | MOD-001 ↔ EXTERNAL (Stripe)          | Upgrade flow fails; no payment collected                |
| P1       | MOD-003 ↔ EXTERNAL (005/006/007/009) | Premium features accessible to free users               |
| P1       | MOD-005 ↔ EXTERNAL (Stripe)          | Lapse not processed; premium features remain accessible |
| P2       | MOD-001 ↔ EXTERNAL (002)             | Tier check wrong; features gated incorrectly            |
| P2       | MOD-004 ↔ EXTERNAL (Stripe)          | Payment fails; upgrade incomplete                       |
| P3       | MOD-006 ↔ MOD-001 (tier badge)       | Badge wrong; user confusion                             |

**Recommendation**: Create `specs/010-subscriptions/v-model/integration-test.md` to address P1/P2 gaps before deployment.
