## Summary

| Layer                     | Status          | Findings                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| code ↔ tasks              | ⚠️ EXPECTED-GAP | `CODE_TASKS_COVERAGE = 0/66` (all tasks unchecked; no implementation packages/artifacts created yet)                     |
| tasks ↔ plan              | ✅ PASS         | Task graph mirrors plan phases and M8 closure sequencing (`T001`–`T066`)                                                 |
| code ↔ plan               | ⚠️ EXPECTED-GAP | Planned architecture and module surfaces are not yet implemented in code workspace                                       |
| plan ↔ spec.md            | ✅ PASS         | Plan addresses must-have stories (US-001..US-007), FR/NFR controls, governance rules, and M8 evidence gates              |
| spec.md ↔ product-spec/   | ✅ PASS         | Spec FR/NFR scope is consistent with product vision, scope, and open-question decisions                                  |
| product-spec/ ↔ research/ | ⚠️ PARTIAL      | Core chain is consistent, but research set is bootstrap-minimal (competitors/UX/tech-stack/metrics-ROI not yet authored) |
| v-model ↔ spec.md         | ⚠️ PARTIAL      | Requirement decomposition and traceability mappings are complete; release audit remains blocked by unexecuted scenarios  |

**Overall**: ❌ **NOT READY FOR M8 EXIT**. Artifact chain is internally coherent at planning/spec level, and traceability mapping gaps are resolved. Verification closure remains blocked by missing implementation evidence, unchecked verify-phase tasks, and unexecuted V-model scenarios.

## CRITICAL Findings

### C-001: Release audit is explicitly blocked by unexecuted scenarios and cannot satisfy M8 verify gate

- **Where**: `specs/014-notification-service/v-model/release-audit-report.md`
- **Evidence**:
    - Compliance status is `❌ BLOCKED`.
    - Report declares `0` missing traceability mapping cell(s).
    - Report declares `186` mapped scenario references with `0 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 186 untested`.
- **Impact**: M8 verification cannot be considered complete while release audit remains blocked.
- **Required closure**: Complete `T057`/`T058`/`T062` and reissue the audit with ingested execution results.

### C-002: Verify-phase task closure is not started (hard gate tasks remain unchecked)

- **Where**: `specs/014-notification-service/tasks.md` (Phase 7, `T057`–`T066`)
- **Evidence**: All verification and M8 closure tasks are unchecked, including `T059` (verify-report objective findings), `T062` (unblock release audit), and `T063` (full regression).
- **Impact**: Required objective evidence for M8 exit is absent.
- **Required closure**: Execute Phase 7 tasks in order and attach evidence links in `review.md`.

## WARNING Findings

### W-001: Code-to-task coverage is currently 0/66 (expected pre-implementation state)

- **Where**: `specs/014-notification-service/tasks.md`; workspace package paths referenced by tasks.
- **Evidence**:
    - `53` total tasks (`T001`–`T066` with gaps by design, 53 defined entries) and all are unchecked.
    - Referenced implementation paths (e.g., `packages/api/notifications-api/*`, `packages/shared/notifications/*`, `specs/014-notification-service/contracts/*`) are not present yet.
- **Why WARNING (not CRITICAL)**: No task is falsely marked complete without corresponding code; this is a bootstrap/no-implementation state.
- **Recommendation**: Begin Phase 1 scaffolding (`T001`–`T009`) before rerunning full verification.

### W-002: Product/research support artifacts are still bootstrap-minimal

- **Where**:
    - `specs/014-notification-service/product-spec/README.md`
    - `specs/014-notification-service/research/README.md`
- **Evidence**:
    - Product-spec indicates user journeys/wireframes/metrics are not yet authored.
    - Research indicates competitors/UX patterns/tech-stack/metrics-ROI are not yet authored.
- **Impact**: Traceability is valid but thin for design and KPI rationale audits.
- **Recommendation**: Author missing artifacts before final release-readiness review.

### W-003: Traceability matrix still contains unresolved `❌ MISSING` mapping cells

- **Where**: `specs/014-notification-service/v-model/traceability-matrix.md`
- **Evidence**: Matrix A rows show `❌ MISSING` for acceptance trace entries while status remains `⬜ Untested`.
- **Impact**: Deterministic requirement→test mapping is incomplete in current published matrix.
- **Recommendation**: Repair trace mappings under `T057` and re-run matrix generation before next verify cycle.

## PASSED Findings

### P-001: Tasks are structurally aligned to the implementation plan

- **Where**: `specs/014-notification-service/plan.md`, `specs/014-notification-service/tasks.md`
- **Evidence**:
    - Plan defines architecture and rollout phases.
    - Tasks encode dependency-ordered execution from foundation through verification (`T001`–`T066`).
    - M8 closure tasks are explicitly represented in Phase 7.

### P-002: Spec and product-spec remain semantically aligned on scope and non-goals

- **Where**: `specs/014-notification-service/spec.md`, `specs/014-notification-service/product-spec/product-spec.md`
- **Evidence**:
    - In-app notification ownership, recipient kinds (`user/group/global`), and `messageType` dispatch model are consistent.
    - Deferred/non-goal items align (email/push/preferences/templating not in launch baseline).
    - Open-question handling in product-spec is reflected in plan/task coordination items.

### P-003: Governance and milestone intent are explicitly captured in planning artifacts

- **Where**: `specs/014-notification-service/plan.md`, `specs/014-notification-service/review.md`
- **Evidence**:
    - Governance constraints (`GR-002`, `GR-007`, `GR-008`, `GR-009`, `GR-011`) are called out with planned conformance.
    - `review.md` tracks M8 entry/remediation/exit states and outstanding verify obligations.

## Metrics Snapshot

- **Total defined tasks**: 53
- **Checked tasks**: 0
- **`CODE_TASKS_COVERAGE`**: `0/53` (0.00)
- **Functional requirements in `spec.md`**: 23 (`FR-001`..`FR-023`)
- **Non-functional requirements in `spec.md`**: 8 (`NFR-001`..`NFR-008`)
- **Success criteria in `spec.md`**: 7 (`SC-001`..`SC-007`)
- **V-model execution state**: Pre-implementation / untested; release audit blocked.

## Gate Decision

**Gate**: Phase 7 `/speckit.product-forge.verify-full` for Feature 014
**Decision**: ❌ **FAIL (blocked)**

Feature 014 has coherent planning/spec artifacts, but the verify-full gate cannot pass until Phase 7 execution evidence exists and V-model mapping/execution blockers are resolved.
