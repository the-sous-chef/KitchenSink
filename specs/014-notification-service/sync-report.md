## Findings by Layer

### ✅ L1 — research ↔ product-spec

**Result: PASSED**

- Core research finding (003 backfill notification, inferred requirement #1) is reflected in `product-spec/user-journey.md` Journey B (`food.backfill.completed → P4 Sam`).
- Q-008 ordering guarantee (per-recipient FIFO / best-effort global) is correctly attributed to industry practice and matched in product-spec open-question resolutions.

**Evidence**
- `/home/brandon/Development/KitchenSink/.worktrees/002-user-auth/specs/014-notification-service/research/codebase-analysis.md` §33
- `/home/brandon/Development/KitchenSink/.worktrees/002-user-auth/specs/014-notification-service/product-spec/user-journey.md` §32

---

### ✅ L2 — product-spec ↔ spec.md

**Result: PASSED**

- All 11 product-spec user stories (US-001..US-011) have corresponding FR/NFR coverage in `spec.md`.
- Must Have stories US-001..US-007 are explicitly addressed in both `spec.md` and `plan.md`.
- US-008..US-011 map to FR-010/FR-020/FR-021 (US-008), FR-017/FR-018 (US-011) and inline spec-risk references (US-009, US-010).

**Evidence**
- `/home/brandon/Development/KitchenSink/.worktrees/002-user-auth/specs/014-notification-service/spec.md` §46 (API Surface), §47 (Scope / Exclusions)
- `/home/brandon/Development/KitchenSink/.worktrees/002-user-auth/specs/014-notification-service/plan.md` §14 (Must Have stories addressed)

---

### ✅ L3 — spec.md ↔ plan.md

**Result: PASSED**

- Plan API surface (`POST /api/v1/notifications/publish`, `GET /api/v1/notifications/subscribe`, `GET /api/v1/notifications/replay`) maps to spec.md FR-001..FR-004, FR-010, FR-012.
- Governance rules GR-002, GR-007, GR-008, GR-009, GR-011 addressed in plan Governance Alignment section.
- Architecture choice (hybrid push + durable replay) is a valid implementation specialization of spec.md Q-001 transport-open decision.

**Evidence**
- `/home/brandon/Development/KitchenSink/.worktrees/002-user-auth/specs/014-notification-service/plan.md` §40–55 (Transport and Queue Architecture)
- `/home/brandon/Development/KitchenSink/.worktrees/002-user-auth/specs/014-notification-service/plan.md` §74–93 (API routes table)
- `/home/brandon/Development/KitchenSink/.worktrees/002-user-auth/specs/014-notification-service/plan.md` §28–36 (Governance Alignment)

---

### ✅ L4 — plan.md ↔ tasks.md

**Result: PASSED**

- Task graph T001–T066 mirrors plan phases: Foundation → Registry → Publish Ingest → Subscribe+Replay → Telemetry → Cross-feature → Verification.
- All Must Have stories (US-001..US-007) have at least one task that covers them.
- Dependency graph DAG is acyclic and matches declared task order.

**Evidence**
- `/home/brandon/Development/KitchenSink/.worktrees/002-user-auth/specs/014-notification-service/tasks.md` §10–18 (Dependency Graph)
- `/home/brandon/Development/KitchenSink/.worktrees/002-user-auth/specs/014-notification-service/tasks.md` §25–83 (Phase 1–2 tasks with US/FR tags)

---

### ⏭️ L5 — tasks.md ↔ code

**Result: SKIPPED** (per instruction)

---

### ℹ️ L6 — tasks.md ↔ code (missing-impl)

**Result: INFO**

- All 66 tasks unchecked. Implementation package paths (`packages/api/notifications-api/*`, `packages/shared/notifications/*`) do not exist on disk.
- Expected for pre-implement phase. No action required.

**Evidence**
- `ls /home/brandon/Development/KitchenSink/.worktrees/002-user-auth/packages/api/notifications-api = NOT_FOUND`
- `ls /home/brandon/Development/KitchenSink/.worktrees/002-user-auth/packages/shared/notifications = NOT_FOUND`
- `tasks.md` shows all task checkboxes `[ ]` unmarked.

---

### ✅ L7 — cross-link integrity

**Result: PASSED**

- All internal relative links resolve to existing files:
  - `./spec.md` → exists
  - `./plan.md` → exists
  - `./tasks.md` → exists
  - `./review.md` → exists
  - `./verify-report.md` → exists
  - `./product-spec/*.md` → exists
  - `./research/*.md` → exists
  - `./v-model/*.md` → exists
- External sibling-feature cross-references (`../002-user-auth/`, `../001-commise-recipe-app/`, etc.) are out-of-scope for internal 014 drift.

**Evidence**
- `/home/brandon/Development/KitchenSink/.worktrees/002-user-auth/specs/014-notification-service/review.md` §100–106
- `/home/brandon/Development/KitchenSink/.worktrees/002-user-auth/specs/014-notification-service/plan.md` §3–4
- `/home/brandon/Development/KitchenSink/.worktrees/002-user-auth/specs/014-notification-service/spec.md` §12–17

## Must-Have Story Traceability (US-001..US-007)

| Story | product-spec | spec.md | plan.md | tasks.md |
|-------|--------------|---------|---------|----------|
| US-001 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| US-002 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| US-003 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| US-004 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| US-005 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| US-006 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| US-007 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

All 7 Must Have stories have end-to-end traceability across the artifact chain.

---

## Out-of-Scope Flags (Monorepo Convention)

| Flag | Severity | Detail |
|------|----------|--------|
| `apps/X` refs | INFO | No `apps/X` references found in the artifact chain. Task file paths use `packages/api/` and `packages/shared/` conventions, consistent with monorepo `packages/apps/commise/{web,mobile}`. |

---

## Conclusion

Artifact chain is **internally consistent at the planning level**. No CRITICAL or WARNING findings. The single INFO finding (L6 missing implementation) is expected given pre-implement phase. Cross-links are intact. Must Have story coverage is complete. Ready for implementation start.
