# Review Log: Notification Service

> Feature: `014-notification-service` | Status: **DRAFT — M8 Planning Artifacts Regenerated**
> Started: 2026-05-12
> Last Updated: 2026-05-12

**Mode**: Product Forge remediation (planning artifacts)
**Milestone**: M8 (Mordor)
**Public Launch**: Post-1.0 (in v1, end of `M8`)
**Launch Plan**: [`v1-launch-plan.md`](../v1-launch-plan.md)
**Governance Rules**: [`governance-rules.md`](../governance-rules.md)

---

## Current Status

Feature 014 now has regenerated planning artifacts aligned to M8 bootstrap remediation requirements:

- `plan.md` — architecture choice (hybrid queue + realtime + replay), trigger inventory, channel scope, preferences strategy, dependency/rollout model.
- `tasks.md` — dependency-ordered atomic task graph with explicit test and governance closure tasks.
- `review.md` — this milestone/governance tracking log.

`verify-report.md` and execution evidence are still pending and are tracked in `tasks.md` (Phase 7).

## M8 Alignment Snapshot

Source: [`../v1-launch-plan.md`](../v1-launch-plan.md) (§3.9 `M8` Milestone Mordor).

### Entry

- [x] M7 dependency acknowledged as external gate.
- [x] Required planning artifacts (`plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `review.md`) exist.

### Artifact Remediation

- [x] Plan/task/review artifacts regenerated from existing 014 inputs.
- [ ] `verify-report.md` generated and burned to `0 CRITICAL, 0 WARNING`.
- [ ] V-model traceability gaps + untested execution gaps closed.
- [x] Notification ownership contract documented per GR-011 in planning artifacts.

### Exit (not yet complete)

- [ ] `verify-report.md` at `0 CRITICAL, 0 WARNING`.
- [ ] `v-model/release-audit-report.md` unblocked with ingested execution results.
- [ ] Integrated notification flows demonstrated across required producer surfaces.

## Governance Conformance (Planning Stage)

Source rules: [`../governance-rules.md`](../governance-rules.md).

| Rule                                                                                                | Planning status   | Evidence                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [GR-002 API URL Prefix Standard](../governance-rules.md#gr-002-api-url-prefix-standard)             | Planned compliant | `plan.md` and `tasks.md` constrain routes to `/api/v1/notifications/*`.                       |
| [GR-007 Shared Type Library Ownership](../governance-rules.md#gr-007-shared-type-library-ownership) | Planned compliant | Tasks explicitly require `@kitchensink/shared-recipe-core`; duplicate local types prohibited. |
| [GR-011 Notification System Ownership](../governance-rules.md#gr-011-notification-system-ownership) | Planned compliant | 014 designated as owner interface; producer-integration tasks enumerated.                     |
| [GR-008 Node.js Runtime Version](../governance-rules.md#gr-008-nodejs-runtime-version)              | Planned compliant | Node 24.x included as setup constraint/tasks.                                                 |
| [GR-009 Package Naming Convention](../governance-rules.md#gr-009-package-naming-convention)         | Planned compliant | Naming checks included in setup/governance tasks.                                             |

No production compliance claim is made until implementation + verification evidence is attached.

## Cross-Feature Trigger Ownership Review (`001`–`013`)

Cross-feature inventory is captured in `plan.md` and converted into coordination tasks (`T042`–`T051`) in `tasks.md`.

### Confirmed / firm triggers

- **003**: `food.backfill.completed`, `food.fetch.failed`.

### High-priority trigger contracts pending producer sign-off

- **005**: AI disclosure/compliance notification taxonomy.
- **008**: timer alert event taxonomy + latency SLO.
- **009**: compliance-gap/deficiency notification scope decision.
- **012**: moderation/action-result creator notifications.
- **013**: publish/enroll milestone notifications.

### Scope decision pending Director/owners

- Whether **006**, **007**, **010** are M8 hard exit blockers or acceptable as hook-ready integrations.

---

## Open Questions (Actionable)

1. **Group membership source of truth** for `recipient.kind=group` (feature-local expansion vs shared identity source).
2. **Transport detail finalization** inside hybrid architecture (subscribe protocol + replay contract details).
3. **M8 blocker list finalization** for `006`, `007`, `010` integration depth.
4. **Trigger ownership roster**: named owner + schema approver + oncall for each producer feature trigger.
