**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Approved with blocking corrections pending

**Milestone**: `M1` Rivendell
**Public Launch**: Beta (end of `M4`)
**Launch Plan**: [`v1-launch-plan.md`](../v1-launch-plan.md)

## Purpose

This file records the iterative revalidation cycle for the Product Forge layer of feature 001. Each revision captures user feedback, the corrections applied, and an explicit approval marker.

This feature was **retroactively bootstrapped** — the SpecKit + V-Model artifacts already existed before Product Forge was layered on. Revalidation here therefore focuses on:

1. Whether the synthesized `research/` and `product-spec/` artifacts faithfully reflect the existing `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `v-model/`, and `data-model.md`.
2. Whether the new artifacts surface any gaps, contradictions, or stale assumptions in the upstream artifacts.
3. Whether the Must Have / Should Have / Could Have decomposition in `product-spec/product-spec.md` matches the user's true product priorities.

**User feedback**: User elected **skip-approval** mode (2026-05-09); no per-question revision cycle requested.

**Corrections applied**: None (skip-approval).

**Approval status**: Approved (skip-approval mode, 2026-05-09).

## Pending Reviewer Questions (Deferred — NOT blocking approval)

1. **MoSCoW decomposition**: `product-spec.md` classifies stories as Must / Should / Could / Won't. Are the priorities correct, or should any move tier?
2. **Personas**: Bootstrapped 3 personas (Home Cook, Meal Planner, Recipe Sharer). Are these the right primary personas?
3. **Net-new stories**: Any stories in `product-spec.md` flagged "Net-new — needs FR added" must be confirmed and pushed back into `spec.md` before implementation.
4. **Metrics**: Story-level metrics in `product-spec/metrics.md` and portfolio-level metrics in `research/metrics-roi.md` — confirm targets are realistic.
5. **Competitive thesis**: `research/competitors.md` differentiation thesis — confirm it matches product strategy.

Cross-feature references to 001 FRs must use the `001-FR-NNN` format. A `specs/cross-feature-FR-index.md` must be created before Phase 2 begins.

**Corrections to 001 artifacts required before engineering handoff**:

- [x] `contracts/api.openapi.yaml` — updated all paths from `/api/*` to `/api/v1/*` (GR-002).
- [x] `tasks.md` — added contract-first task to create and publish `@kitchensink/shared-recipe-core` before API/UI implementation (GR-007).
- [x] `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and related Product Forge/V-Model docs — updated public API path references to `/api/v1/*`.

**Approval status**: Approved (skip-approval, 2026-05-09). Corrections above are now resolved for documentation handoff. Implementation remains `not-started`; release readiness still depends on real implementation and V-Model execution evidence.

## Revision 2 — Governance Correction (2026-05-10)

**Author**: Senior Product Owner (cross-feature governance)
**Trigger**: Director review rejection — release audits contradicted their own data; CR-001 decision in Revision 1 was incorrect.

### Corrections Applied

1. **CR-001 decision reversed**: Revision 1 incorrectly stated "001 is canonical" and that downstream features should align to `/api/v1/*`. The portfolio standard S-001 (adopted during 002 revalidation on 2026-05-09) established `/api/v1/v{N}/*` as the canonical pattern. Feature 001 must add the `/v1` segment to its OpenAPI contract — it is not exempt from the standard it helped establish. The Revision 1 table entry has been corrected in-place with a strikethrough and supersession note.

2. **CR-002 framing corrected**: The original decision said "not a 001 bootstrap blocker." This is true for the bootstrap phase but was misleading about handoff. The correction clarifies that creating `@kitchensink/shared-recipe-core` is a **blocking** prerequisite for engineering handoff, not merely a follow-up task.

3. **Status updated**: Review status changed from "Pending initial human review" to "Approved with blocking corrections pending" to accurately reflect the current state.

### Blocking Corrections for Engineering Handoff

These items must be resolved before 001 enters implementation:

| Item                                                                   | Rule   | Status                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Update `contracts/api.openapi.yaml` paths from `/api/*` to `/api/v1/*` | GR-002 | ✅ Resolved 2026-05-13 |
| Add `@kitchensink/shared-recipe-core` creation task to `tasks.md`      | GR-007 | ✅ Resolved 2026-05-13 |
| Update `spec.md` and `plan.md` API path references                     | GR-002 | ⬜ Pending             |

### Governance Reference

All cross-feature governance rules are now formally defined in [`../governance-rules.md`](../governance-rules.md). That document is the authoritative source for acceptance criteria and violation definitions.
