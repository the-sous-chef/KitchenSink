# Metrics: Sous Chef Recipe Management Core — Story-Level

**Branch**: `001-sous-chef-recipe-app`
**Date**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: [product-spec.md](./product-spec.md), [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Distinction from research/metrics-roi.md**: That file covers portfolio-level ROI and business outcomes. This file is story-level — per-user-story measurable outcomes for product teams.

## Metric Notation

Each metric is tied to a Must Have user story. "Measurable" means a queryable signal (API telemetry, DB query, or UX event) with a defined target and measurement window.

## Signalfreeze

Metrics are measured via a combination of:

- **API telemetry**: CloudWatch / Datadog on NestJS API endpoints
- **DB queries**: Scheduled nightly queries against `recipe_versions`, `recipes`, `users` tables
- **UX events**: Analytics events emitted by web and mobile clients (Segment / Posthog)
- **E2E smoke tests**: Playwright tests that validate metric invariants on every PR (e.g., deleted recipe not in search results)

| Signal type               | Tooling                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| API latency / error rates | CloudWatch Metrics + Alerts           |
| DB metric queries         | pgDash / CloudWatch Database Insights |
| UX events                 | Segment / Posthog                     |
| E2E smoke assertions      | Playwright `*.spec.ts`                |
