# Product Specification: Sous Chef - Recipe Management Core

**Branch**: `001-sous-chef-recipe-app`
**Date**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Vision

Sous Chef is a recipe management platform that treats cooking as a craft worth organizing, sharing, and preserving. It combines the permanence of a personal cookbook with the discoverability of a social platform. Every recipe is versioned, attributable, and nutritiously annotated. The experience feels like a professional chef's digital notebook — structured, trustworthy, and personal.

**Tagline**: "Your recipes, versioned and verified."

**Core principles**:

- Recipes are first-class citizens with full version history and nutritional backing.
- Sharing is opt-in and attribution-preserving.
- Privacy is tier-gated (free = public-only; premium = private recipes).
- Concurrency conflicts are surfaced transparently — the user decides, not the system.

## Personas

### Persona 1 (Primary): P8 Alex — Sous Chef Power User

**Archetype**: Sous Chef Power User
**Core motivation**: Multi-feature daily power use, integrations, automation

**Profile**: Alex cooks seriously and often. They use Sous Chef as a daily kitchen brain — capturing recipes from multiple sources, versioning every tweak, and pulling up instructions hands-free mid-cook. They expect the app to keep up with them, not slow them down.

**Feature-specific goals**:

- Capture and version recipes rapidly, with full edit history preserved so no iteration is ever lost.
- Scale servings on the fly and trust that nutritional data recalculates correctly.
- Search by ingredient across their entire library ("what can I make with chicken and lemon right now?").
- Resolve concurrent-edit conflicts themselves rather than having the system silently overwrite.
- Integrate with external tools (shopping lists, meal planners) via a stable API.

**Feature-specific pains**:

- Conflict resolution on other platforms is opaque — the last writer wins with no warning.
- Photo uploads are slow and break the flow of a rapid recipe-capture session.

### Persona 2 (Secondary): P3 Riley — Family Meal Planner

**Archetype**: Family Meal Planner
**Core motivation**: Quick, kid-friendly, weekly rotation, household scale

**Profile**: Riley plans the week's meals on Sunday and needs everything in one place. They build themed collections (Weekly Rotation, Kid-Friendly, Quick Weeknights), clone recipes from the community, and share collections with a partner. Nutrition at a glance matters, but deep macro tracking doesn't.

**Feature-specific goals**:

- Build and maintain themed collections that the whole household can browse.
- Clone community recipes into a private collection and pull updates from the source when the original author improves them.
- Get a high-level nutrition summary across a collection without manual calculation.
- Share a collection with a partner without making every recipe public.

**Feature-specific pains**:

- Copying recipes manually between apps wastes Sunday planning time.
- No pull-from-source after cloning means divergence is invisible until something tastes wrong.

---

### Persona 3 (Tertiary): P5 Morgan — Discovery Seeker

**Archetype**: Discovery Seeker
**Core motivation**: New cuisines, inspiration, expanding repertoire

**Profile**: Morgan browses public recipes for inspiration, tries cuisines they've never cooked before, and occasionally publishes their own originals. Attribution matters to them — they want credit when someone clones their work, and they give credit when they adapt someone else's.

**Feature-specific goals**:

- Discover public recipes by cuisine, dietary tag, and ingredient without needing an account.
- Publish original recipes publicly with confidence that attribution is preserved through clones.
- Track how many times a recipe has been cloned as a lightweight signal of quality.
- Use version history to see how a recipe evolved before deciding to clone it.

**Feature-specific pains**:

- On other platforms, edits to cloned recipes are invisible to the original author.
- Photo-heavy recipe uploads are cumbersome and interrupt the creative flow.

---

## Internal Stakeholders

### Support Operator

**Role**: Internal customer-support and moderation staff who access the admin console to handle user reports, resolve account issues, and moderate public recipe content. Support Operators are NOT end users of the recipe features; they interact with the platform through back-office tooling. Their needs (audit logs, moderation queues, user-lookup APIs) are tracked separately from user-facing requirements.

---

## Web/Mobile Parity Policy

Every user-facing feature in Sous Chef ships on **both** web and mobile in the same release. This is a hard product constraint, not a best-effort goal.

**Rule**: Any task that implements a user-facing screen, flow, or interaction MUST have a corresponding task for the other platform, OR carry an explicit documented exception in the task itself explaining why parity is deferred and which future spec will close the gap.

**Enforcement**: The Phase 6 parity audit task (T060) is not sufficient on its own. Parity is enforced at task-creation time: every frontend implementation task is either a paired web+mobile task or two separate tasks (one web, one mobile) that are explicitly linked. A single task covering only one platform without a documented exception is a blocking defect.

**Exceptions that are pre-approved** (no separate task needed):

- Platform-specific auth SDK integration (Auth0 web SDK vs. react-native-auth0) — covered by spec 002.
- Expo/React Native device APIs with no web equivalent (camera, haptics, push notifications) — must be noted in the task.
- Maestro vs. Playwright E2E tooling — different tools for the same flow are expected and correct.

## Epics

### Epic 0: Post-Login Home (P1)

The first screen a user sees after logging in is the Home screen. It is not a generic dashboard or a bare recipe list. It is a personalized, context-aware entry point that surfaces the most valuable next action for that user at that moment.

The Home screen shows:

- **Resume cooking**: if the user has an active cooking-mode session, a prominent "Resume" card appears at the top.
- **Recent recipes**: the user's 4 most recently viewed or edited recipes, with a quick-add button.
- **This week's meal plan**: a compact summary of today's and tomorrow's planned meals (links to meal planning; shows an "Add meals" prompt if empty).
- **Nutrition snapshot**: today's planned macro totals vs. the user's nutrition goal (links to nutrition planning; shows a setup prompt if no goal is set).
- **Shopping list**: count of unchecked items on the active shopping list, with a "View list" shortcut (shows "No active list" if none).
- **AI suggestion**: one AI-generated recipe suggestion based on the user's recent cooking history (links to AI feature; shows a "Try AI" prompt for new users).
- **Subscription prompt**: for free-tier users, a contextual upgrade nudge appears when they interact with a premium-gated entry point (private recipes, advanced nutrition). The nudge is non-intrusive and appears at most once per session.

The Home screen is identical in structure on web and mobile. Layout adapts to screen size (responsive grid on web, vertical scroll on mobile) but every entry point is present on both platforms.

### Epic 1: Recipe Lifecycle (P1)

The recipe is the central entity. Authenticated users create, read, update, and soft-delete recipes they own. Every save creates a version. Concurrent edits trigger a visible conflict flow.

**User stories**: US-001, US-002, US-003, US-004, US-005

**FR coverage**: FR-001, FR-001a, FR-002, FR-003, FR-007, FR-007a, FR-007b, FR-007b-i, FR-007c, FR-044, FR-045

---

### Epic 2: Search and Discovery (P2)

All authenticated users can search public recipes. Search is full-text with GIN indexes, filtered by keyword, tags, cuisine, dietary category, ingredient, and prep/cook time.

**User stories**: US-006

**FR coverage**: FR-006

---

### Epic 3: Sharing and Cloning (P3)

Public recipes are discoverable and cloneable. Cloning creates a private copy owned by the cloner. Collections can be cloned as snapshots with opt-in pull-from-source.

**User stories**: US-007, US-008

**FR coverage**: FR-004, FR-005, FR-011

---

### Epic 4: Collections (P3)

Users organize recipes into named collections. Collections can be public or private, owned by the user, and support add/remove of recipes.

**User stories**: US-009

**FR coverage**: FR-008, FR-009, FR-010, FR-012

| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| US-007 | As an authenticated user, I can clone any public recipe into my own collection so that I have a private copy I can edit independently of the original.                                          | [FR-005](../spec.md#fr-005)                                                           | 1. Clone action creates a new recipe in caller's collection. 2. Clone is owned by caller. 3. Source attribution is preserved.                    |
| US-008 | As a premium user, after making a substantive edit (ingredients or instructions) to a clone of an imported recipe, I can set my clone to private so that it is no longer publicly discoverable. | [FR-005](../spec.md#fr-005), [C-004](../spec.md#c-004)                                | 1.

| US-010 | As an authenticated user who has cloned a public collection, I can invoke a "Pull updates from source" action that reconciles my clone with the source's current public membership without overwriting recipes I added directly. | [FR-011](../spec.md#fr-011)   | 1. Pull action shows preview of additions/removals. 2. Confirm adds new public recipes. 3. Directly-added recipes are unchanged.                       |
| US-011 | As a recipe owner, I can view a version history timeline showing the last 10 saved versions of my recipe so that I can compare changes over time.                                                                                | [FR-007b](../spec.md#fr-007b) | 1.

| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| US-012 | Per-user recipe sharing (sharing with specific named users)       | Deferred to future spec. Public/private is sufficient for v1.                                                                             |

- Per-user sharing of individual recipes (covered by future spec)
- Meal planning, grocery lists, cooking mode, nutrition planning (separate specs)
- AI recipe generation (separate spec)
- Mobile notifications / push
- Offline-first mode (future iteration)
