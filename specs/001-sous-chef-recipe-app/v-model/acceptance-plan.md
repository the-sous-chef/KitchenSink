# Acceptance Test Plan: Sous Chef - Recipe Management Core

**Feature Branch**: `001-sous-chef-recipe-app`
**Created**: 2026-04-30
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/001-sous-chef-recipe-app/v-model/requirements.md`

## Overview

This document defines the Acceptance Test Plan for Sous Chef - Recipe Management
Core. Every requirement in `requirements.md` has one or more Acceptance Test
Cases (ATP), and every ATP has one or more executable BDD scenarios (SCN) in
strict Given/When/Then format.

## Test Plan Context

- **Test Level:** Acceptance
- **Entry Criteria:**
    1. `system-test.md` execution evidence shows all P1 system tests passing.
    2. UAT/staging environment is deployed and reachable for web, mobile, API, and required dependencies.
    3. Seed data and test harness assets required by ATP scenarios are available.
- **Exit Criteria:**
    1. All P1 ATPs pass.
    2. Zero open Critical/Major defects linked to this feature scope.
    3. Coverage Summary shows 100% requirement coverage against the current baseline (129 requirements).

## Traceability Policy

- The traceability baseline is **129 requirements** from `requirements.md` (including atomic sub-IDs).
- ATP linkage uses explicit atomic sub-IDs where requirements were decomposed for independent testability (e.g., REQ-035a/b, REQ-038a/b/c, REQ-049a/b).
- Umbrella IDs MAY be retained in addition to atomic links only when needed for readability; atomic links are authoritative for coverage.
- `REQ-010c` is treated as a known upstream reference anomaly (preamble-only mention, no requirement row) and is excluded from coverage accounting unless promoted to a formal requirement row in `requirements.md`.

## ID Schema

- **Test Case**: `ATP-{NNN}-{X}` for functional requirements (e.g., `ATP-008-B`)
- **Scenario**: `SCN-{NNN}-{X}{#}` for functional requirements (e.g., `SCN-008-B1`)
- **Category-prefixed IDs**:
    - Non-functional: `ATP-NF-{NNN}-{X}`, `SCN-NF-{NNN}-{X}{#}`
    - Interface: `ATP-IF-{NNN}-{X}`, `SCN-IF-{NNN}-{X}{#}`
    - Constraint: `ATP-CN-{NNN}-{X}`, `SCN-CN-{NNN}-{X}{#}`

## Verification Method Notes (ISO 29119 Test vs Inspection/Analysis)

- The following ATPs are **non-executable acceptance checks** and are validated via **Inspection** or **Analysis** as specified in `requirements.md`:
    - **Analysis:** ATP-NF-004-A, ATP-NF-015-A
    - **Inspection:** ATP-NF-005-A, ATP-NF-005-B, ATP-NF-006-A, ATP-NF-008-A, ATP-NF-009-A, ATP-NF-010-A, ATP-NF-011-A, ATP-NF-011-B, ATP-NF-012-A, ATP-NF-013-A, ATP-NF-014-A, ATP-NF-016-A, ATP-NF-017-A, ATP-NF-018-A, ATP-NF-018-B, ATP-NF-019-A, ATP-NF-019-B, ATP-NF-020-A, ATP-041-A, ATP-041-B, ATP-IF-004-A
- All other ATPs are executable test cases unless otherwise stated.
