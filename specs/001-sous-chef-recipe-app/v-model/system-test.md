# System Test Plan: Sous Chef - Recipe Management Core

**Feature Branch**: `001-sous-chef-recipe-app`
**Created**: 2026-04-30
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/001-sous-chef-recipe-app/v-model/system-design.md`

## Overview

This document defines the System Test Plan for Sous Chef - Recipe Management Core. Every system component in `system-design.md` has one or more Test Cases (STP), and every Test Case has one or more executable System Scenarios (STS) in technical BDD format (Given/When/Then).

System tests verify **architectural behavior**, not user journeys. Language is technical and component-oriented.

## ID Schema

- **System Test Case**: `STP-{NNN}-{X}` — where NNN matches the parent SYS, X is a letter suffix (A, B, C...)
- **System Test Scenario**: `STS-{NNN}-{X}{#}` — nested under the parent STP, with numeric suffix (1, 2, 3...)
- Example: `STS-001-A1` → Scenario 1 of Test Case A verifying SYS-001

## ISO 29119 Test Techniques

Each test case identifies its technique by name:

- **Specification-Based Testing** — Verifies API contracts and specification conformance from the Interface View (with Equivalence Partitioning used as the primary input/output class validation technique where applicable)
- **Boundary Value Analysis** — Tests data limits from the Data Design View
- **Equivalence Partitioning** — Tests representative data classes
- **Decision Table Testing** — Systematically verifies multi-condition policy combinations and expected outcomes
- **State Transition Testing** — Verifies valid/invalid transitions and terminal-state guards for defined lifecycle state machines
- **Error Guessing** — Exercises high-risk undocumented edge cases and defensive error paths beyond formal partitions
- **Performance Testing** — Verifies non-functional response-time behavior and load objectives under defined environments (ISO 29119-10)

## System Tests

### Component Verification: SYS-001 (Auth0 Identity and Access Guard)

**Parent Requirements**: REQ-017, REQ-024, REQ-050b, REQ-052, REQ-IF-005a, REQ-IF-005b, REQ-IF-005c

#### Test Case: STP-001-A (JWT Validation and Authorization Contract)

**Technique**: Specification-Based Testing
**Target View**: Interface View
**Description**: Verifies that authenticated principal extraction, scope validation, and owner-authorization checks enforce endpoint contracts across protected API surfaces.

- **System Scenario: STS-001-A1**
    - **Given** an Auth0-issued bearer token signed by a known JWKS key with unexpired `exp` and required scopes
    - **When** the guard processes `GET /api/recipes/{id}` for a resource the principal can access
    - **Then** the request pipeline receives principal context (`userId`, tier, claims) and the endpoint continues with HTTP 200 response behavior

- **System Scenario: STS-001-A2**
    - **Given** a protected endpoint call with either a missing bearer token or a token lacking required scopes
    - **When** the guard validates identity and authorization claims
    - **Then** the guard returns HTTP 401 for missing/invalid tokens or HTTP 403 for insufficient scope, and downstream handlers are not executed

#### Test Case: STP-001-B (Identity Dependency Failure Isolation)

**Technique**: Error Guessing
**Target View**: Dependency View
**Description**: Verifies fail-closed behavior when Auth0/JWKS dependencies degrade and owner checks fail.

- **System Scenario: STS-001-B1**
    - **Given** JWT verification requires JWKS retrieval and the JWKS endpoint times out
    - **When** the guard attempts signature verification for an inbound token
    - **Then** the guard fails closed with HTTP 401 and no protected route logic runs

- **System Scenario: STS-001-B2**
    - **Given** a valid authenticated principal attempts `PATCH /api/recipes/{id}` for a recipe owned by a different principal
    - **When** owner authorization is evaluated
    - **Then** the guard returns HTTP 403 and no recipe mutation SQL statements are issued

#### Test Case: STP-001-C (JWT High-Risk Error-Path Guesses)

**Technique**: Error Guessing
**Target View**: Dependency View
**Description**: Verifies JWT edge cases (clock skew, replay, JWKS unavailability during cache miss) as high-risk failure paths beyond formal partitions.

- **System Scenario: STS-001-C1**
    - **Given** a bearer token with `nbf`/`exp` near validation boundaries and verifier clock skew relative to issuer time
    - **When** temporal claim validation executes
    - **Then** behavior is deterministic at skew-tolerance boundaries and fails closed outside configured tolerance

- **System Scenario: STS-001-C2**
    - **Given** a previously accepted bearer token is replayed for a protected action context
    - **When** guard validation and authorization checks execute for the replayed request
    - **Then** replay is rejected and no duplicate protected side effects are committed

- **System Scenario: STS-001-C3**
    - **Given** signature verification requires JWKS refresh on cache miss while JWKS endpoint is unavailable
    - **When** JWT signature verification executes
    - **Then** the guard fails closed with HTTP 401 and no protected route logic runs

**Description**: Verifies create/update/delete/clone command behaviors, response contracts, and atomic metadata persistence semantics.

- **System Scenario: STS-002-A1**
    - **Given** a valid `CreateRecipeRequest` payload with title, ingredients, ordered steps, times, servings, and tags
    - **When** `POST /api/recipes` is processed
    - **Then** the service commits metadata tables atomically, creates recipe version `1`, defaults visibility to `public`, and returns HTTP 201 with persisted fields

- **System Scenario: STS-002-A2**
    - **Given** an existing recipe and a valid update payload referencing the current version
    - **When** `PATCH /api/recipes/{id}` is executed
    - **Then** the update increments version, persists mutation state, and response contracts conform to documented status codes

- **System Scenario: STS-002-A3**
    - **Given** an existing recipe eligible for owner deletion
    - **When** `DELETE /api/recipes/{id}` is executed
    - **Then** delete applies tombstone semantics with HTTP 204 and command response contracts conform to documented status codes

#### Test Case: STP-002-B (Command Payload Boundary Enforcement)

**Technique**: Boundary Value Analysis
**Target View**: Data Design View
**Description**: Verifies non-negative time fields, positive servings constraints, and rejection of boundary violations without partial writes.

- **System Scenario: STS-002-B1**
    - **Given** recipe command payloads with `prepTimeMinutes=0`, `cookTimeMinutes=0`, `totalTimeMinutes=0`, and `servings=1`
    - **When** create or update command validation executes
    - **Then** payload validation succeeds and metadata writes are committed

- **System Scenario: STS-002-B2**
    - **Given** recipe command payloads with negative time values or `servings=0`
    - **When** command validation executes
    - **Then** the service returns HTTP 400 with deterministic field errors and no recipe/version rows are created or updated

    - **Given** three recipe classes: premium-owned standard recipe, free-tier owned standard recipe, and paid-source imported recipe
    - **When** policy evaluation processes requested visibility transitions to `private`
    - **Then** premium standard transition is allowed, free-tier transition is denied, and paid-source transition is denied regardless of tier

- **System Scenario: STS-003-A2**
    - **Given** a physical-copy imported recipe at creation and a subscription-lapsed account with pre-existing private recipes
    - **When** policy defaults and post-lapse transition checks are evaluated

#### Test Case: STP-003-B (Substantive Edit Classification Boundaries)

**Technique**: Boundary Value Analysis
**Target View**: Data Design View
**Description**: Verifies exact field-boundary rules for substantive edits used by privacy unlock logic.

- **System Scenario: STS-003-B1**
    - **Given** a clone of a public-source imported recipe with no prior substantive edit
    - **When** an edit mutates at least one ingredient row or one instruction step
    - **Then** the policy engine classifies the change as substantive and marks unlock eligibility as true for premium accounts

- **System Scenario: STS-003-B2**
    - **Given** a clone of an imported recipe exists in the user's library with zero edits applied
    - **When** substantive-edit classification executes without any edit operations
    - **Then** substantive classification remains false and private-visibility unlock remains denied

- **System Scenario: STS-003-B3**
    - **Given** a clone of an imported recipe exists and edits are limited to metadata/photo fields (title, description, tags, photo attachments) with no ingredient/instruction mutations
    - **When** substantive-edit classification executes for metadata/photo-only edits
    - **Then** substantive classification remains false and private-visibility unlock remains denied

#### Test Case: STP-004-B (Ingredient Data-Class Partitioning)

**Technique**: Equivalence Partitioning
**Target View**: Data Design View
**Description**: Verifies behavior classes for linked ingredients, freeform without manual nutrition, and freeform with manual nutrition.

- **System Scenario: STS-004-B1**
    - **Given** recipe ingredient payloads containing one linked ingredient and one unmatched freeform ingredient without manual macros
    - **When** nutrition resolution runs during recipe save
    - **Then** linked ingredient macros are resolved from catalog, freeform entry remains user-entered with nullable macro fields, and aggregation flags partial user-supplied nutrition

- **System Scenario: STS-004-B2**
    - **Given** an unmatched freeform ingredient containing explicit manual values for calories, protein, carbohydrate, and fat
    - **When** nutrition resolution executes
    - **Then** manual values are persisted and returned as the effective nutrition source for that ingredient class

    - **When** `GET /api/search/recipes` is executed with combined keyword and structured filter parameters
    - **Then** results include only active recipes, return `results/total/page/pageSize/facets/appliedFilters`, and preserve deterministic ordering for selected `sortBy`

- **System Scenario: STS-005-A2**
    - **Given** invalid filter payloads (for example non-UUID ingredient IDs or unsupported `sortBy` values)
    - **When** search request validation executes

**Description**: Verifies strict enforcement of maximum 10 photos per recipe and maximum 5 MB per file across upload URL and confirmation flows.

- **System Scenario: STS-006-A1**
    - **Given** a recipe with 9 existing photos and an upload request containing `fileSize=5242880`
    - **When** `POST /api/recipes/{recipeId}/photos/upload-url` is processed
    - **Then** the service returns HTTP 200 with a presigned URL and object key because both boundaries are valid

- **System Scenario: STS-006-A2**
    - **Given** either `fileSize=5242881` or a recipe already containing 10 photos
    - **When** upload URL creation or photo confirmation is requested

- **System Scenario: STS-006-B1**
    - **Given** an uploaded object whose declared `contentType=image/jpeg` does not match inspected magic bytes
    - **When** `POST /api/recipes/{recipeId}/photos/confirm` validates object metadata and content signature
    - **Then** the service rejects confirmation with per-file reason details, marks retryability, and avoids persisting a valid recipe-photo reference for the failed object

- **System Scenario: STS-006-B2**
    - **Given** recipe metadata is already committed and one photo upload previously failed
    - **When** a retry path requests a new upload URL and submits a valid confirm payload for only the failed file
    - **Then** the retry succeeds independently with HTTP 201 and no metadata re-save operation is required

#### Test Case: STP-006-C (Upload/Confirm Concurrency Error-Path Guesses)

    - **Given** a multipart upload with missing or incomplete parts where confirm is requested before object completeness is guaranteed
    - **When** `POST /api/recipes/{recipeId}/photos/confirm` validates staged object integrity
    - **Then** confirmation is rejected deterministically, retryability is preserved, and no finalized photo attachment is persisted

- **System Scenario: STS-006-C2**
    - **Given** concurrent confirm requests target the same uploaded object key for a recipe
    - **When** both confirmation paths race through idempotency and persistence checks
    - **Then** at most one confirm operation commits attachment finalization and duplicate-success side effects are prevented

**Description**: Verifies S3 event handling, derivative generation, and processing-state transitions for recipe photos.

- **System Scenario: STS-007-A1**
    - **Given** an S3 ObjectCreated event with bucket/key metadata for a confirmed recipe photo
    - **When** the Lambda handler retrieves the original and runs Sharp processing pipelines
    - **Then** derivative objects are written to expected prefixes and the associated `recipe_photos.processing_status` transitions to `complete` with populated dimensions

- **System Scenario: STS-007-A2**
    - **Given** a valid HEIC/HEIF source object in the allowed media set
    - **When** the processor executes format conversion and rendition generation
    - **Then** output objects are generated in supported delivery formats and the persisted photo record points to CDN-deliverable keys

#### Test Case: STP-007-B (Photo Processing Failure Behavior)

**Technique**: Error Guessing
**Target View**: Dependency View
**Description**: Verifies retry/failure semantics when object retrieval or transformation fails.

- **System Scenario: STS-007-B1**
    - **Given** the Lambda receives an event for an object key that cannot be decoded by Sharp
    - **When** transformation execution throws a processing exception
    - **Then** the photo record transitions to a failed/non-complete state with an explicit error reason, preserving no broken finalized attachment

- **System Scenario: STS-007-B2**
    - **Given** transient S3 read timeouts during source retrieval
    - **When** Lambda invocation retries under configured retry policy
    - **Then** processing remains retryable and state does not transition to `complete` until a successful end-to-end run occurs

#### Test Case: STP-007-C (Photo Lifecycle State Machine Transition Guards)

**Technique**: State Transition Testing
**Target View**: Operational States
**Description**: Verifies valid transitions (`PHOTO_PENDING` → `PHOTO_PROCESSING` → `NORMAL` and `PHOTO_PENDING` → `PHOTO_FAILED`), invalid transition attempts, and terminal-state re-entry guards for photo lifecycle.

- **System Scenario: STS-007-C1**
    - **Given** a photo is in `PHOTO_PENDING` with a valid staged object and a corresponding processing trigger event
    - **When** the processor consumes the event and completes derivative generation successfully
    - **Then** state transitions `PHOTO_PENDING` → `PHOTO_PROCESSING` → `NORMAL` and the photo record is marked `complete`

- **System Scenario: STS-007-C2**
    - **Given** a photo is in `PHOTO_PENDING` and processing prerequisites are not satisfied (missing/invalid staged object)
    - **When** confirmation or completion is attempted before processing can start
    - **Then** the invalid transition is rejected, the record does not move to `complete`, and state moves to or remains in `PHOTO_FAILED` with explicit reason

- **System Scenario: STS-007-C3**
    - **Given** a photo is already in terminal `complete` state
    - **When** a duplicate or replayed processing trigger arrives for the same photo key
    - **Then** terminal-state re-entry is prevented and no second processing side effects are applied

    - **Given** a recipe at server version `7` and an update payload with `expectedVersion=7`
    - **When** `PATCH /api/recipes/{id}` executes
    - **Then** the mutation succeeds, a new recipe version row is created, and the resulting recipe version increments to `8`

- **System Scenario: STS-008-A2**
    - **Given** a recipe at server version `8` and an update payload with `expectedVersion=7`
    - **When** optimistic concurrency validation executes

**Technique**: Boundary Value Analysis
**Target View**: Data Design View
**Description**: Verifies retention boundary for latest 10 database versions and immutable historical snapshot semantics.

- **System Scenario: STS-008-B1**
    - **Given** a recipe with 12 pre-seeded version rows (versions `1..12`) established via deterministic seed fixtures
    - **When** `GET /api/recipes/{recipeId}/versions` is requested
    - **Then** exactly the most recent 10 versions (`3..12`) are returned from primary database storage

- **System Scenario: STS-008-B2**
    - **Given** a restore request for historical version `5`
    - **When** `POST /api/recipes/{recipeId}/versions/5/restore` executes

**Technique**: Error Guessing
**Target View**: Dependency View
**Description**: Verifies defensive handling for high-risk edge conditions not fully covered by primary partitions (e.g., stale payload shape and replayed mutation intents).

- **System Scenario: STS-008-C1**
    - **Given** a conflict-prone update request where `expectedVersion` is omitted or non-numeric due to malformed client payload
    - **When** concurrency validation executes
    - **Then** request is rejected deterministically with HTTP 400 and no mutation/version side effects occur

- **System Scenario: STS-008-C2**
    - **Given** a client retries an update after receiving HTTP 409 but reuses stale conflict metadata from a previous attempt
    - **When** overwrite/merge follow-up submission is evaluated against current server version
    - **Then** stale replay is rejected with HTTP 409 and the latest server state remains authoritative until explicit valid resolution input is provided

| PRF-STP-002 | Remapped affected technique declarations from `Fault Injection` to `Error Guessing` in `STP-001-B`, `STP-007-B`, `STP-009-B`, `STP-010-B`, `STP-013-B`, `STP-014-B`, `STP-015-B`, and `STP-019-B`.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| PRF-STP-003 | Added `STP-010-C` (State Transition Testing) with `STS-010-C1..C5` covering success path, failure path, DLQ replay, invalid transition on `NORMAL`, and terminal-state re-entry guard.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| PRF-STP-004 | Split compound `STS-003-B2` into atomic cases: updated `STS-003-B2` (clone exists with zero edits) and added `STS-003-B3` (metadata/photo-only edits).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| PRF-STP-005 | Extracted latency/load scenario to new `STP-005-C` (`Performance Testing`) with explicit non-functional conditions; retained `STP-005-B` as boundary-only coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| PRF-STP-006 | Added `STP-003-C` using `Decision Table Testing` with explicit tier × source × edit-state matrix outcomes for `private` transition decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| PRF-STP-007 | Added Error Guessing cases for additional high-risk components: `STP-001-C` (JWT edge cases), `STP-006-C` (upload/confirm race conditions), and `STP-013-D` (erasure/session concurrency).                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| PRF-STP-008 | Clarified `STS-008-B1` Given clause to deterministic seeded setup: recipe with 12 pre-seeded version rows (`1..12`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| PRF-STP-009 | Added flat `STS Index (Grouped by STP)` under Coverage Summary so scenario totals are independently verifiable from document structure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
