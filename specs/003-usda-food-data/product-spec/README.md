| Artifact      | File                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Spec  | [product-spec.md](./product-spec.md)  | Vision, personas, epics, MoSCoW story map with FR traceability, and out-of-scope list. The single source of truth for v1 product scope interpretation.                                                        |
| User Journeys | [user-journey.md](./user-journey.md)  | End-to-end flows for three personas covering P1/P2/P3 stories, plus cross-persona edge cases for pending status, queue delay, and not-found handling. Includes Mermaid sequence diagrams and coverage matrix. |
| Wireframes    | [wireframes/](./wireframes/README.md) | ASCII conceptual wireframes for five domain screens: food search, food detail, ingredient picker, nutrition panel, and food substitution. Each wireframe annotates FR coverage.                               |
| Metrics       | [metrics.md](./metrics.md)            | Per-story measurable outcomes for Must Have stories. Distinct from `research/metrics-roi.md`, which covers portfolio-level ROI and system-level SLO framing.                                                  |
