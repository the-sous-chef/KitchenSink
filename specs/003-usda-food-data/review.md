# Product Forge Revalidation Log: Feature 003

**Branch**: `003-usda-food-data`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Pending initial human review
**Mode**: Retroactive bootstrap
**Milestone**: `M1` Rivendell
**Public Launch**: Beta (end of `M4`)
**Launch Plan**: [`v1-launch-plan.md`](../v1-launch-plan.md)

## Purpose

This file records the iterative revalidation cycle for the Product Forge layer of feature 003. Each revision captures user feedback, the corrections applied, and an explicit approval marker.

This feature was **retroactively bootstrapped** — the SpecKit + V-Model artifacts already existed before Product Forge was layered on. Revalidation here therefore focuses on:

1. Whether the synthesized `research/` and `product-spec/` artifacts faithfully reflect the existing `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `v-model/requirements.md`.
2. Whether the new artifacts surface any gaps, contradictions, or stale assumptions in the upstream artifacts.
3. Whether the Must Have / Should Have / Could Have decomposition in `product-spec/product-spec.md` matches true launch priorities for USDA integration.

## Revision Log

### Revision 0 — Initial Bootstrap (2026-05-09)

**Author**: Sisyphus (Product Forge bootstrap)
**Trigger**: User-requested retroactive bootstrap for feature 003.

**Artifacts produced**:

- [research/competitors.md](./research/competitors.md)
- [research/ux-patterns.md](./research/ux-patterns.md)
- [research/codebase-analysis.md](./research/codebase-analysis.md)
- [research/tech-stack.md](./research/tech-stack.md)
- [research/metrics-roi.md](./research/metrics-roi.md)
- [product-spec/product-spec.md](./product-spec/product-spec.md)
- [product-spec/user-journey.md](./product-spec/user-journey.md)
- [product-spec/wireframes/](./product-spec/wireframes/)
- [product-spec/metrics.md](./product-spec/metrics.md)

**Synthesis sources**:

| Bootstrapped File    | Primary Source(s)                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| competitors.md       | `research.md` (RQ-1, RQ-3)                        |
| ux-patterns.md       | `research.md` (RQ-8), `spec.md` user stories      |
| codebase-analysis.md | `plan.md`, root `package.json`, `AGENTS.md`       |
| tech-stack.md        | `plan.md`, `research.md`, `spec.md` FR-001..035   |
| metrics-roi.md       | `spec.md` NFR-001..010, SC-001..009               |
| product-spec.md      | `spec.md` user stories + FR-001..035              |
| user-journey.md      | `spec.md` user stories P1/P2/P3                   |
| wireframes/          | `spec.md` FRs + clarifications                    |
| metrics.md           | `spec.md` success criteria + FR-traceable stories |

**Known constraints during synthesis**:

- No new requirements were invented.
- Domain asks for ingredient matching + unit conversion UX; where no direct FR exists, it is marked as warning/non-blocking gap in `verify-report.md`.
- Existing `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and `v-model/*` were not modified.

**User feedback**: Superseded by Revision 1.

**Corrections applied**: See Revision 1.

**Approval status**: Superseded.

### Revision 1 — Open-question resolution pass (2026-05-10)

**Author**: Sisyphus
**Trigger**: User review of `product-spec/product-spec.md` open questions Q-001..Q-008.

**User feedback (verbatim)**:

- "first, there should be no code whatsoever, so it makes sense that none of the folders exist."
- "What I said about the data-\* packages holds and we shouldn't have a recipe-core package."
- "Rather than prescribing, we should be a bit more generic instead… The actual decision of what patterns and architectural best practices to use and what to name them should be decided at implementation."
- "For q-005, yes."
- "For q-008, sounds good"

**Decisions recorded**:

| ID    | Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Q-001 | Notification delivery owned by a new dedicated notification-service feature. Producers publish messages with recipient descriptor (single/group/global) + `messageType` keyword. Clients receive messages whose recipient matches; exact delivery mechanism (WebSocket push, webhook callback, client-pull retrieval, or hybrid) deferred to implementation. Client dispatches on `messageType`. Launch transport scope: in-app only. 003 publishes `food.backfill.completed` and fetch-failure events; does not own transport/templates/preferences. |
| Q-002 | PostgreSQL FTS for launch; search must sit behind a pluggable interface so the engine can be swapped later. Concrete abstraction shape decided at implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Q-003 | No `recipe-core` package. Food/ingredient types stay local to feature 003's data layer. Cross-feature sharing, package boundaries, and naming deferred to implementation; spec stays generic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Q-004 | USDA attribution shown in the ingredient detail view. Footer/settings/API `source` field out of scope for launch unless compliance review flags it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Q-005 | Normalization is a first-class concern of the search/resolution layer and must be compatible with the pluggable backend from Q-002 (rules/synonyms above the engine boundary). Specific pipeline decided at implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Q-006 | Cadence and staleness thresholds are configurable. Defaults: weekly bulk sync, 3-day `fetched_at` staleness threshold. Per-dataset overrides and breaking-change invalidation handled at implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Q-007 | Use a badge on each search result to distinguish branded vs generic (and surface data-type provenance). Sort order and ranking weights deferred to implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Q-008 | Backfill prioritization is demand-weighted: duplicate / repeated requests for a pending food increase its effective priority. Static high/normal flags removed. Exact weighting and time-decay decided at implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

**Corrections applied**:

- `product-spec/product-spec.md` US-005 rewritten as **"Demand-weighted backfill priority and DLQ recovery"** with Redis sorted-set / duplicate-request-driven prioritization and in-app notification on backfill completion.
- `product-spec/product-spec.md` Open Questions section: Q-001..Q-008 all marked ✅ RESOLVED with the decisions above.

**Still open**: None within feature 003. A new notification-service feature must be specced separately (see Follow-ups).

**Follow-ups (outside feature 003)**:

- Spec a new feature for the notification service (pub/sub with WebSocket + webhook delivery, recipient descriptors, `messageType` dispatch). Launch scope: in-app only. Defer preferences/templates/email/push.
- Update `specs/cross-feature-consistency-report.md` §5.3 to point to the new notification feature once specced.

**Approval status**: ⏳ Awaiting reviewer confirmation of Revision 1.

## Pending Reviewer Questions

When the user reviews, please confirm or correct the following inferred decisions:

1. **MoSCoW decomposition**: Should P3 items (WebSocket notifications, advanced observability surfaces) remain Could Have for launch?
2. **Food disambiguation depth**: Is the current disambiguation UX (brand vs generic + data-type badges) sufficient for initial release?
3. **Ingredient matching / substitution**: `food-substitution` and `ingredient-picker` wireframes are included as UX references, but direct FR support is partial. Should explicit FRs be added in a follow-up spec revision?
4. **Unit conversion UX**: Cross-unit conversion is represented as a panel-level affordance; confirm whether this should remain informational or become a hard functional requirement.
5. **Metrics targets**: Confirm realism of p95 fetch and cache-hit goals in `research/metrics-roi.md` and `product-spec/metrics.md`.
