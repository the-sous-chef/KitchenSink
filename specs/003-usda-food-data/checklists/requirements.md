### 5. Success Criteria Measurability

- [x] All 8 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) have quantitative thresholds
- [x] Criteria are time-bound or condition-bound (not open-ended)
- [x] Criteria align with Commise integration (SC-008 references SC-010)

**Evidence**: SC-001: "50ms at p95". SC-002: "never exceed 1,000 requests/hour". SC-003: "60 seconds at p95". SC-004: "80% cache hit rate after 5,000 foods". SC-005: "5,000 foods/hour".

**Result**: PASS

---

### 6. Assumption Validity

- [x] All 9 assumptions (A-001 through A-009) are realistic and documented with rationale
- [x] No assumptions contradict the architecture document
- [x] Assumptions document defaults that can be overridden

**Evidence**: A-001 (rate limit hard constraint) aligns with architecture doc section 2.1. A-002 (lean launch default) aligns with architecture doc "Lean Launch" section. A-003 (eventual consistency) aligns with 202 Accepted pattern. A-004 (USDA API availability) is a reasonable external dependency assumption. A-005 (AWS us-east-1) aligns with architecture. A-006 (monorepo workspace) aligns with Constitution Principle V. A-007 (polling over WebSocket) aligns with architecture "Option A". A-008 (foods table scope) correctly delineates boundaries. A-009 (Secrets Manager) aligns with security best practices.

**Result**: PASS

---

### 7. Edge Case Coverage

- [x] Edge cases cover boundary conditions (invalid input, extreme values)
- [x] Edge cases cover error paths (API down, infrastructure failure)
- [x] Edge cases cover concurrency issues (thundering herd, duplicate requests)

**Evidence**: 9 edge cases documented. Boundary: invalid fdcId format. Error paths: USDA API extended downtime, Redis unavailability, PostgreSQL unavailability, token bucket state loss. Concurrency: thundering herd deduplication, Lambda timeout mid-processing. Data quality: missing nutrient fields in USDA response. Recovery: tombstone re-check after 90 days.

**Result**: PASS

---

### 8. Constitution Compliance

- [x] NFRs use verbatim language from Constitution principles where applicable
- [x] No NFR paraphrases or weakens a Constitution requirement
- [x] All workspace governance rules (Principle V) are addressed

**Evidence**: NFR-001 uses "strict: true" and "no `any`" matching Principle I verbatim. NFR-002 uses "JSDoc block comments" matching Principle II. NFR-003 uses "@kitchensink/_, @web/_, @kitchensink/<pkg>" and ".js/.jsx extensions" matching Principle III verbatim. NFR-006 explicitly names shared configs and Turbo declaration matching Principle V. NFR-007 names exact turbo commands matching Principle VI. NFR-004/NFR-005 match Principles IV/VII on accessible names and color requirements.

**Result**: PASS

---

### 9. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Markers

- [x] Maximum of 3 markers allowed
- [x] All markers (if any) have clear rationale for why clarification is needed

**Evidence**: Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers found in spec. All requirements are fully specified. This is within the 3-marker maximum.

**Result**: PASS

---

### 10. Internal Consistency

- [x] FR numbering is sequential (001-034) with no gaps or duplicates
- [x] User story priority levels (P1/P2/P3) are clearly assigned and follow the 5/3/2 distribution
- [x] Entity references in FRs match entity definitions in the Key Entities section
- [x] Event names are consistent across FRs (FoodRequested, FoodBatchRequested, IngestionScheduled, FoodDataReceived, FetchFailed)

**Evidence**: FR-001 through FR-034 verified sequential. P1: 5 stories (US-1 through US-5), P2: 3 stories (US-6 through US-8), P3: 2 stories (US-9 through US-10). Event names in FR-011/FR-012/FR-024/FR-032/FR-034 match FoodDataEvent types in Key Entities. Fetch status values in FR-028 match Food entity definition. Queue names (High Priority, Low Priority, DLQ) are consistent throughout.

**Result**: PASS

---

### 11. Prose Quality and Formatting

- [x] Spec prose is clear with no grammatical errors
- [x] Markdown formatting is correct (headings, lists, code formatting)
- [x] Technical terms are used consistently (fdcId, fetch_status, token bucket)

**Evidence**: Reviewed full spec (329 lines). Markdown headings follow hierarchy (H1 -> H2 -> H3). Code terms use backtick formatting consistently (`fdcId`, `fetch_status`, `202 Accepted`). JSON examples are properly formatted. No grammatical issues identified.

**Result**: PASS

---

### 12. Commise Integration

- [x] FR-007 from Commise spec is explicitly satisfied (food/nutrition database backing)
- [x] Ingredient lookup flows are clearly defined (single and batch)
- [x] Meal plan and grocery list integration points are identified or correctly scoped out

**Evidence**: Food entity description explicitly states "This entity fulfills Commise FR-007." FR-002 defines the data returned (calories, protein, carbs, fat, micronutrients). US-4 covers bulk ingredient lookup for recipe import. A-008 correctly scopes the boundary: "Integration with Commise's `ingredients` entity... is a downstream concern handled by the Commise recipe management feature."

**Result**: PASS

---

### 13. Architecture Alignment

- [x] All FRs map to architecture components (SQS, Lambda, EventBridge, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- [x] Token bucket parameters match architecture doc (1,000 capacity, 16.67 tokens/min)
- [x] Lean launch variant is considered alongside full architecture
- [x] Queue configuration matches architecture doc (visibility timeouts, DLQ retention, max receive count)

**Evidence**: FR-019 specifies "1,000 tokens" and "16.67 tokens per minute" matching architecture doc section 3.2. FR-020 specifies both Redis Lua script and PostgreSQL variant. FR-022 specifies "reserved concurrency of 1" matching architecture. FR-017 specifies visibility timeouts (60s high, 120s low). FR-016 specifies max receive count of 3. FR-018 specifies 14-day DLQ retention. FR-013 covers both Redis and PostgreSQL dedup mechanisms.

**Result**: PASS

---

### 14. No Unresolved Ambiguities

- [x] All functional requirements use precise MUST/MAY/MUST NOT language
- [x] No vague terms like "should consider", "might need", "as appropriate"
- [x] Numeric thresholds are specified where applicable (latencies, counts, timeouts)

**Evidence**: All 34 FRs use MUST or MUST NOT. FR-034 correctly uses MAY for the optional WebSocket feature. All latency targets are specific: 50ms (SC-001), 200ms (SC-007, FR-010), 60 seconds (SC-003). All configuration values are specified: 1,000 tokens, 16.67/min, 30-day staleness, 14-day DLQ retention, 24-hour Redis TTL.

**Result**: PASS

---

### 15. Traceability

- [x] Each user story traces to at least one FR
- [x] Each critical FR is covered by at least one success criterion
- [x] Success criteria can be validated through the acceptance scenarios

**Evidence**: Story-to-FR mapping verified in item 2 above. Critical FR traceability: FR-001/FR-002 -> SC-001 (cache hit latency). FR-019/FR-022 -> SC-002 (rate limit compliance). FR-011/FR-024 -> SC-003 (async completion time). FR-001 -> SC-004 (cache hit rate). FR-023 -> SC-005 (batch throughput). FR-016/FR-018 -> SC-006 (zero data loss). FR-008/FR-010 -> SC-007 (search latency). FR-024 -> SC-008 (data accuracy).

**Result**: PASS

---

### 16. Completeness

- [x] Security is addressed (A-009: API key in Secrets Manager, FR-006: input validation)
- [x] Monitoring is addressed (US-10, SC-006: DLQ alarm)
- [x] Error handling is addressed (FR-025 through FR-027: 404/429/5xx handling, NFR-009: custom errors)
- [x] No obvious omissions for a data integration feature of this scope

**Evidence**: Security: A-009 covers API key management, FR-006 covers input validation. Monitoring: US-10 defines CloudWatch dashboard with queue depth, token bucket, latency, error rate metrics. Error handling: FR-025 (404 tombstone), FR-026 (429 bucket reset), FR-027 (5xx retry + DLQ), NFR-009 (typed custom errors with type guards). Data lifecycle: creation (FR-011/FR-012), storage (FR-028/FR-029/FR-030), staleness (FR-031/FR-032), tombstoning (FR-025). Notification: polling (FR-033) and optional WebSocket (FR-034).

**Result**: PASS
