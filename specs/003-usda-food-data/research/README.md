This directory contains the Product Forge Phase 1 research artifacts for feature 003. Each file synthesizes existing SpecKit/V-Model output into a focused domain document.

## File Index

### [competitors.md](./competitors.md)

Competitive landscape for food/nutrition data providers covering USDA FoodData Central, Edamam, Spoonacular, Open Food Facts, Nutritionix, and Cronometer-style sourcing patterns. Includes parity matrix, launch-fit trade-offs, and differentiation thesis for event-driven local caching over direct third-party pass-through.

### [ux-patterns.md](./ux-patterns.md)

UX pattern reference for food search-as-you-type, food disambiguation (brand vs generic), ingredient picker workflows, nutrition panel behavior, pending-status polling, and substitution affordances. Each pattern maps to spec user stories and FR IDs.

### [codebase-analysis.md](./codebase-analysis.md)

Monorepo and implementation fit analysis grounded in root `package.json`, `AGENTS.md`, and `plan.md`. Covers current workspace baseline, USDA-specific package boundaries, queue + Lambda placement, API versioning path, and integration points with Sous Chef applications.

### [tech-stack.md](./tech-stack.md)

Technology stack rationale extracted from `research.md` RQ-1..RQ-8 and `plan.md`. Covers API + data model, SQS/EventBridge/Lambda queueing model, token bucket strategy (Redis/PostgreSQL variants), PostgreSQL search (`pg_trgm` + FTS), and observability stack.

### [metrics-roi.md](./metrics-roi.md)

Success metrics and ROI hypothesis for the food data layer. Covers SLOs from `SC-001..SC-009`, constitutional NFR guardrails (`NFR-001..NFR-010`), throughput/cost guardrails under USDA limits, and product-level impact metrics for ingredient resolution quality.

| `../plan.md`                 | Technical architecture and implementation sequencing      |
| `../tasks.md`                | Execution-level decomposition                             |

| `../v-model/requirements.md` | Atomic requirement decomposition and verification framing |

## What Is Grounded vs. TBD

- **Grounded**: Rate limits, queue priorities, polling-first launch approach, USDA endpoint boundaries, and strict local-read architecture.
- **TBD / Warning-surfaced**: First-class substitution semantics and hard unit-conversion requirements (currently represented as UX guidance, not explicit FRs).
