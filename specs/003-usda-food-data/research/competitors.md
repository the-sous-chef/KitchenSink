## Competitive Landscape Overview

USDA integration competes less on frontend polish and more on data coverage, licensing terms, update cadence, and operational constraints under rate limits. The key decision axis is whether Sous Chef should be USDA-first with local persistence (chosen), or API-aggregation first with external pass-through (rejected for this feature).

## Market Gaps 003 Targets

1. **Queue-native nutrition lookup**: Most integrations still do synchronous pass-through calls.
2. **Deterministic pending-state UX**: Explicit pending/polled lifecycle for first-time lookups.
3. **Brand-vs-generic disambiguation at ingredient pick time**: Better recipe-quality nutrition outcomes.
4. **Cost-resilient architecture**: No per-request API vendor spend for core nutrition source.

---

## Differentiation Thesis

Feature 003 differentiates by combining authoritative USDA sourcing with an event-driven local-cache architecture that protects user latency and cost profile. The strategic advantage is not “another nutrition API client” — it is predictable recipe-time UX under hard external rate limits, with explicit disambiguation and ingredient-level linking semantics that compound in downstream features (meal planning, grocery lists, nutrition planning).
