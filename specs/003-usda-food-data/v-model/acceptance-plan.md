# Acceptance Test Plan: USDA Food Data

**Feature Branch**: `003-usda-food-data`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/003-usda-food-data/v-model/requirements.md`, `specs/003-usda-food-data/v-model/system-test.md`

---

## Overview

This plan maps BDD acceptance scenarios to every REQ-\* requirement in the USDA Food Data Integration feature. Each scenario is written from the perspective of an authenticated Commise client interacting with the public API surface, not from the perspective of internal components. Internal component behavior is covered by the System Test Plan (`system-test.md`).

Acceptance tests verify that the system satisfies user-observable contracts: correct HTTP status codes, correct response bodies, correct async backfill behavior, correct search results, and correct authentication enforcement. Non-functional acceptance criteria (latency, rate-limit compliance, data fidelity) are verified through targeted load probes and metric assertions.

Coverage is complete: every P1 and P2 functional, non-functional, and interface requirement has at least one acceptance test case and one BDD scenario. P3 requirements (optional enhancements) are noted but excluded from the shippable exit gate.

**Total BDD Scenarios**: 43

---

## Exit Criteria

The feature is considered shippable when **all** of the following conditions are true:

### Functional Gate

- [ ] All 43 BDD acceptance scenarios pass in a staging environment connected to a real USDA FoodData Central API key
- [ ] Zero `400`, `401`, `404`, or `500` responses observed for valid authenticated requests to locally-cached foods
- [ ] Deduplication confirmed: concurrent lookups for the same unknown `fdcId` produce exactly one `FoodRequested` event
- [ ] DLQ routing confirmed: messages that exhaust 3 retry attempts appear in the DLQ within the expected window

### Performance Gate

- [ ] p95 cache-hit lookup latency is under 50ms (REQ-NF-011)
- [ ] p95 search latency is under 200ms at 50,000 local records (REQ-010)
- [ ] p95 async backfill latency is under 60 seconds with queue depth under 100 (REQ-NF-013)
- [ ] Token bucket compliance confirmed: at most 1,000 USDA API calls in any 60-minute window; zero `429` responses in CloudWatch (REQ-NF-012)

### Data Integrity Gate

- [ ] Nutritional values for at least 5 spot-checked foods match USDA source values exactly (REQ-NF-018)
- [ ] Zero messages silently dropped under fault injection; all failed messages appear in DLQ (REQ-NF-016)

### CI Gate

- [ ] `turbo run typecheck lint format:check` exits 0 with zero errors on the feature branch (REQ-NF-007)
- [ ] Test pyramid ratios met: at least 70% unit, at most 20% integration, at most 10% E2E (REQ-NF-008)

### Security Gate

- [ ] All `/v1/foods/*` endpoints return `401 Unauthorized` for unauthenticated requests (REQ-035)
- [ ] USDA API key is not present in any client-facing response body or application log (REQ-IF-006)

### Out of Scope for This Gate

- REQ-034 (WebSocket push notifications) is P3 and optional; it is excluded from the shippable exit gate
- REQ-NF-014 (80% cache hit rate) and REQ-NF-015 (batch throughput) are P2 analysis targets measured post-launch once the local store reaches 5,000+ foods; they do not block the initial ship
- REQ-NF-017 (99.9% monthly availability) is measured over a rolling calendar month and cannot be verified pre-launch; it is tracked via CloudWatch SLA dashboard post-deploy
