> Note: "Inspection-Only" requirements are verified by code review and static analysis, not by executable tests. They are fully covered by their stated verification method. REQ-020 (atomic token bucket) is covered exclusively by unit tests (UTP-005-A through UTP-005-C) rather than acceptance tests — this is intentional given the internal implementation nature of the atomicity guarantee. REQ-034 (WebSocket) is P3 optional and excluded from the shippable exit gate.

**Orphan ATs** (acceptance tests with no corresponding REQ):

> None identified. All AT cases in `acceptance-plan.md` map to a REQ-\* identifier via the naming convention (AT-NNN-X → REQ-NNN) or explicit REQ cross-reference in the tier heading.

**Orphan UTPs** (unit test cases with no corresponding MOD):

> None identified. All UTP cases in `unit-test.md` map to a MOD-NNN identifier via the module section header.

**Orphan REQs** (requirements with no verification path):

> None identified. All 66 requirements have at least one verification method (Test, Inspection, or Analysis).

### Gap Analysis

**Requirements with no executable acceptance test (Inspection/Analysis only)**:

These requirements are verified by code review, static analysis, or architectural analysis — not by executable test scenarios. They are **not gaps** but are flagged for completeness:

| REQ-ID     | Verification Method | Risk Level | Mitigation                                                                                              |

| REQ-NF-015 | Analysis            | Low        | Batch throughput metric tracked via CloudWatch; no executable test possible pre-production              |
| REQ-NF-017 | Analysis            | Low        | Availability SLA tracked via CloudWatch; no executable test possible pre-production                     |
| REQ-IF-005 | Inspection          | Low        | EventBridge event schemas verifiable by code review and CDK event bus rule definitions                  |

**Functional requirements covered only by unit tests (no acceptance test)**:

| REQ-ID  | Unit Test Coverage              | Risk Level | Notes                                                                                                                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| REQ-020 | UTP-005-A, UTP-005-B, UTP-005-C | Medium     | Atomicity is an internal implementation detail; acceptance-level verification is REQ-019 (AT-019-A) which validates the observable outcome |
| REQ-029 | AT-010-A (indirect)             | Low        | Index existence is verified indirectly by the 200ms search latency acceptance test; direct inspection via `\d foods` in PostgreSQL         |

**P3 requirements excluded from shippable exit gate**:

| REQ-ID  | Requirement                  | Reason                                                                                                         |
