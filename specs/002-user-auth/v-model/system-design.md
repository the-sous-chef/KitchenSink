# System Design: User Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `002-user-auth`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/002-user-auth/v-model/requirements.md`

## Overview

The User Authentication system decomposes into platform-specific authentication clients (web/mobile), a shared API Gateway authorizer Lambda, an IdP user.created webhook server-side handler, backend account management handlers, and cross-cutting observability/infrastructure components. The system bridges the IdP with the Commise PostgreSQL database, ensuring every IdP user has a corresponding User and Account record.

## ID Schema

- **System Component**: `SYS-NNN` — sequential identifier for each component
- **Parent Requirements**: Comma-separated `REQ-NNN` list per component (many-to-many)
- Example: `SYS-003` with Parent Requirements `REQ-001, REQ-005` — component satisfies both requirements
