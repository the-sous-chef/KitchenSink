# Architecture Design: User Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `002-user-auth`
**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/002-user-auth/v-model/system-design.md`

> **Identity-key note (Feature 002 implementation update)**: Architecture details in this draft that mention generated UUID user IDs, `app_metadata.userId`, `identity_id`, `internal_id`, or `legacy_id` are historical and superseded by the implemented sub-keyed model. Current architecture uses IdP `sub` as `users.sub VARCHAR(255) COLLATE "C" PRIMARY KEY`, with M2M-gated post-login upsert and no generated user UUID.

## Overview

The identity provider (IdP) User Authentication architecture decomposes 20 system components into 32 architecture modules organized across four Kruchten 4+1 views. The decomposition separates platform-specific auth clients (web/mobile) from shared backend services, isolates the API Gateway authorizer as a standalone Lambda, and extracts cross-cutting concerns (observability, shared types, CDK infrastructure) into dedicated utility modules. Every SYS-NNN from system-design.md appears as a parent in at least one ARCH-NNN.

## ID Schema

- **Architecture Module**: `ARCH-NNN` — sequential identifier for each module
- **Parent System Components**: Comma-separated `SYS-NNN` list per module (many-to-many)
- **Cross-Cutting Tag**: `[CROSS-CUTTING; rationale: shared infrastructure supports multiple SYS components]` for infrastructure/utility modules not traceable to a specific SYS
- Example: `ARCH-003` with Parent System Components `SYS-001, SYS-004` — module serves both components
- Example: `ARCH-010 [CROSS-CUTTING; rationale: shared infrastructure supports multiple SYS components]` — infrastructure module with rationale

## Logical View — Component Breakdown (IEEE 42010 / Kruchten 4+1)

| ARCH ID  | Name                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Parent System Components | Type      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| ARCH-001 | Web Auth Route Handler               | Next.js App Router middleware powered by `@clerk/nextjs` — `clerkMiddleware()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`. Handles login redirect to Clerk Hosted UI, post-auth session establishment, and logout. No `/api/auth/[...]` catch-all route is required; Clerk middleware manages redirects directly.                                                                                                                     | SYS-001                  | Component |
| ARCH-002 | Web Auth Middleware Guard            | Next.js middleware that intercepts requests to protected routes, checks for a valid session cookie, and redirects unauthenticated users to the IdP login page.                                                                                                                                                  | SYS-001                  | Component |
| ARCH-003 | Web Session Cookie Manager           | Manages the Clerk `__session` httpOnly cookie written and rotated automatically by the Clerk SDK. Server helpers `auth()` and `currentUser()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server` expose session claims and user data without manual cookie handling.                                                                    | SYS-001                  | Component |
| ARCH-004 | Mobile Auth Provider                 | React context provider using `<ClerkProvider>` from `@clerk/expo` with `tokenCache` backed by `expo-secure-store`. Exposes `useAuth()` and `useUser()` hooks. Detects missing session on app launch and triggers the Clerk Hosted UI login screen automatically.                                                | SYS-002                  | Component |
| ARCH-005 | Mobile Secure Token Store            | Abstraction over `expo-secure-store` for reading/writing access tokens and refresh tokens to iOS Keychain / Android Keystore. Exposes `getToken()`, `setToken()`, `clearTokens()`.                                                                                                                                | SYS-002                  | Component |
| ARCH-006 | Mobile Auth Callback Handler         | Handles the deep-link redirect URI after IdP authorization. Exchanges the authorization code for tokens and stores them via ARCH-005.                                                                                                                                                                           | SYS-002                  | Component |
| ARCH-007 | Social Connection Configurator       | Configures IdP social connections (Google, etc.) in the IdP tenant. Surfaces social login buttons on both web (ARCH-001) and mobile (ARCH-004) login screens.                                                                                                                                                 | SYS-003                  | Component |
| ARCH-008 | Token Refresh Service (Web)          | Clerk issues short-lived JWTs (default 60-second expiry) and refreshes them silently and automatically via the `@clerk/nextjs` SDK — no custom refresh service is required. This module's role is reduced to a session-staleness detector: if `auth()` returns no session after a refresh attempt, it redirects to the Clerk login page.                                                                             | SYS-004, SYS-001         | Service   |
| ARCH-009 | Token Refresh Service (Mobile)       | Clerk issues short-lived JWTs refreshed silently and automatically by the `@clerk/expo` SDK. This module's role is reduced to a session-staleness detector: if `useAuth()` signals a signed-out state after a silent refresh attempt, it clears secure store and triggers re-authentication via `<ClerkProvider>`.                                                                                                 | SYS-004, SYS-002         | Service   |
| ARCH-010 | Post-registration IdP handler        | IdP server-side hook (Node.js 22.x) that fires on `post-user-registration`. Generates UUIDv4, writes it to `app_metadata.userId`, then calls ARCH-011 to provision the Sous Chef user record.                                                                                                                             | SYS-005                  | Service   |

| ARCH-012 | Reconciliation Lambda                | AWS Lambda (Node.js 22.x) triggered on schedule (EventBridge) or via API endpoint. Fetches IdP user list, compares with Sous Chef DB, and calls ARCH-011 for any missing records.                                                                                                                               | SYS-007                  | Service   |
| ARCH-013 | Profile View Component               | Web + mobile UI component that fetches and displays the authenticated user's display name, email, avatar, and account creation date from the Sous Chef API.                                                                                                                                                       | SYS-008                  | Component |

    RH->>CM: Set httpOnly session cookie
    CM-->>RH: Cookie set
    RH-->>Browser: 302 Redirect to /protected-route (with session cookie)
```

**Concurrency Model**: Single-threaded Node.js event loop (Next.js serverless function)
**Synchronization Points**: State parameter validated before token exchange to prevent CSRF

### Interaction 2: Mobile Login Flow (Authorization Code + PKCE)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Expo App
    participant AP as ARCH-004 Mobile Auth Provider
    participant IdP as IdP (External)
    participant CB as ARCH-006 Mobile Auth Callback Handler
    participant TS as ARCH-005 Mobile Secure Token Store

    App->>AP: App launch (useAuth hook)
    AP->>TS: getToken() — no token found
    TS-->>AP: null
    AP->>IdP: Open IdP login screen (PKCE)
    IdP-->>App: Login UI presented
    App->>IdP: Submit credentials
    IdP-->>App: Deep-link redirect (custom scheme + code)
    App->>CB: Handle deep-link callback
    CB->>IdP: POST /oauth/token (code + code_verifier)
    IdP-->>CB: access_token + refresh_token
    CB->>TS: setToken(access_token, refresh_token)
    TS-->>CB: Stored (Keychain/Keystore)
    CB->>AP: Auth state updated (authenticated)
    AP-->>App: Render protected content
```

**Concurrency Model**: React Native event loop; token storage is async (expo-secure-store)
**Synchronization Points**: Auth state update is atomic via React context dispatch

### Interaction 3: Silent Token Refresh (Web)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Browser
    participant TRS as ARCH-008 Token Refresh Service (Web)
    participant CM as ARCH-003 Web Session Cookie Manager
    participant IdP as IdP (External)
    participant MW as ARCH-002 Web Auth Middleware

    Client->>MW: GET /protected-route (expired access token)
    MW->>TRS: Access token expired — attempt silent refresh
    TRS->>IdP: POST /oauth/token (grant_type=refresh_token)
    alt Refresh succeeds
        IdP-->>TRS: New access_token + refresh_token
        TRS->>CM: Update session cookie with new tokens
        CM-->>TRS: Cookie updated
        TRS-->>MW: Refresh successful
        MW-->>Client: 200 OK (protected content)
    else Refresh token expired/revoked
        IdP-->>TRS: 401 invalid_grant
        TRS-->>MW: Refresh failed
        MW-->>Client: 302 Redirect to IdP login
    end
```

**Concurrency Model**: Single-threaded serverless; refresh is synchronous within the request lifecycle
**Synchronization Points**: The Clerk `__session` cookie is written atomically by the SDK; no manual lock is required

### Interaction 4: Post-Registration User Provisioning

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant IdP as IdP (External)
    participant PRA as ARCH-010 Post-registration IdP handler
    participant UPL as ARCH-011 User Provisioning Lambda
    participant DB as PostgreSQL (RDS)

    IdP->>PRA: post-user-registration event (user object)
    PRA->>PRA: Generate UUIDv4 userId
    PRA->>IdP: Management API: set app_metadata.userId
    PRA->>UPL: POST /internal/provision-user {identityId, userId, email}
    loop Retry up to 3x (exponential backoff)
        UPL->>DB: INSERT INTO users (id, identity_id, email, ...)
        UPL->>DB: INSERT INTO accounts (user_id, ...)
        alt Success
            DB-->>UPL: OK
            UPL-->>PRA: 200 OK
        else Transient failure
            DB-->>UPL: Error
            UPL->>UPL: Wait (backoff) and retry
        end
    end
    alt All retries exhausted
        UPL-->>PRA: 500 Error
        PRA-->>IdP: Handler failure (logged to Sentry)
    end
```

**Concurrency Model**: Post-registration IdP handler runs in isolated Node.js 22.x sandbox; Lambda is single-threaded per invocation
**Synchronization Points**: DB writes are transactional (User + Account in single transaction)

---

### Interaction 5: API Request Authorization

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client (Web/Mobile)
    participant APIGW as API Gateway
    participant Auth as ARCH-024 JWT Authorizer Lambda
    participant SC as ARCH-025 Suspension Status Checker
    participant Handler as Backend Handler Lambda

    Client->>APIGW: HTTP Request (Authorization: Bearer <JWT>)
    APIGW->>Auth: Invoke authorizer (token)
    Auth->>Auth: Fetch JWKS from IdP (cached)
    Auth->>Auth: Validate signature, expiry, audience, issuer
    Auth->>Auth: Extract app_metadata.userId claim
    Auth->>SC: Check suspension status (userId)
    alt User active
        SC-->>Auth: Active
        Auth-->>APIGW: IAM Allow policy + userId context
        APIGW->>Handler: Forward request + userId context
        Handler-->>Client: 200 OK (response)
    else User suspended
        SC-->>Auth: Suspended
        Auth-->>APIGW: IAM Deny policy
        APIGW-->>Client: 403 Forbidden
    else Invalid token
        Auth-->>APIGW: IAM Deny policy
        APIGW-->>Client: 401 Unauthorized
    end
```

**Concurrency Model**: Lambda per-request; JWKS cached in Lambda memory (warm invocations reuse cache)
**Synchronization Points**: JWKS cache TTL prevents thundering herd on key rotation

## Data Flow View — Data Transformation Chains (Kruchten 4+1)

### Flow 1: Web Login — Authorization Code to Session Cookie

```
[IdP] → authorization_code (query param)
  → ARCH-001 (Web Auth Route Handler): code exchange via /oauth/token
  → {access_token: JWT, refresh_token: JWT, id_token: JWT}
  → ARCH-003 (Web Session Cookie Manager): serialize to encrypted cookie
  → httpOnly session cookie (browser)
```

**Intermediate formats**:

- IdP callback: `?code=<string>&state=<string>`
- Token response: `{access_token, refresh_token, id_token, expires_in}`
- Session cookie: encrypted `__session` cookie (managed automatically by `@clerk/nextjs`)

---

### Flow 2: Mobile Login — Authorization Code to Secure Store

```
[IdP] → authorization_code (deep-link URI)
  → ARCH-006 (Mobile Auth Callback Handler): code exchange via /oauth/token
  → {access_token: JWT, refresh_token: JWT}
  → ARCH-005 (Mobile Secure Token Store): write to Keychain/Keystore
  → ARCH-004 (Mobile Auth Provider): update React context (isAuthenticated: true)
```

**Intermediate formats**:

- Deep-link: `sous-chef://auth/callback?code=<string>&state=<string>`
- Token response: `{access_token, refresh_token, expires_in}`
- Secure store: key-value pairs in OS secure storage

---

### Flow 3: Post-Registration — IdP Event to Database Records

```
[IdP post-user-registration event]
  → ARCH-010 (Post-registration IdP handler): generate UUIDv4, set app_metadata
  → {identityId: string, userId: UUIDv4, email: string}
  → ARCH-011 (User Provisioning Lambda): INSERT User + Account
  → PostgreSQL: users table + accounts table
```

**Intermediate formats**:

- IdP server-side hook event: `PostUserRegistrationEvent` (IdP SDK type)
- Provisioning request: `{identityId, userId, email}` (JSON over HTTPS)
- DB records: `users(id, identity_id, email, status, created_at)` + `accounts(id, user_id, ...)`

---

### Flow 4: API Request — JWT to Authorized Handler Context

```
[Client] → Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
  → ARCH-024 (JWT Authorizer Lambda): validate JWT (JWKS)
  → {userId: UUIDv4, sub: string, impersonation?: boolean}
  → ARCH-025 (Suspension Status Checker): check status
  → IAM Allow policy + {userId} context
  → [Backend Handler Lambda]: receives userId in requestContext
```

**Intermediate formats**:

- JWT: Base64url-encoded header.payload.signature
- JWKS: JSON Web Key Set (fetched from IdP, cached in Lambda memory)
- IAM policy: `{principalId, policyDocument: {Statement: [{Effect, Action, Resource}]}, context: {userId}}`

---

### Flow 5: Account Deletion — Confirmation to Full Cascade

```
[User types "DELETE"] → ARCH-016 (Deletion Component): validate confirmation
  → DELETE /account (with Bearer JWT)
  → ARCH-024 (JWT Authorizer): validate + extract userId
  → ARCH-017 (Account Deletion Handler):
      1. DELETE FROM accounts WHERE user_id = userId (cascade to user-owned data)
      2. DELETE FROM users WHERE id = userId
      3. IdP Backend API: DELETE /api/v2/users/{identityId}
  → ARCH-001/ARCH-004: logout (clear session/tokens)
  → [Auth screen]
```

**Intermediate formats**:

- Confirmation: `{confirmation: "DELETE"}` (request body)
- DB cascade: PostgreSQL ON DELETE CASCADE on foreign keys
- IdP deletion: Management API `DELETE /api/v2/users/{identityId}`

## Physical View — Deployment Topology

The feature deploys within the Sous Chef AWS/serverless topology. Client-facing web/mobile modules run in their respective application packages. Backend API, worker, queue, database, cache, storage, observability, and infrastructure modules deploy to the configured AWS account and region. Each ARCH module maps to the runtime described in the Logical View and the package/source paths listed in the Development View.

## Development View — Source Organization

Implementation modules are organized by platform and service boundary: web code under Next.js application packages, mobile code under Expo packages, backend services under API/Lambda packages, shared contracts under shared TypeScript packages, and infrastructure under CDK/IaC packages. This view constrains ownership, build boundaries, and deployment units for every ARCH-NNN module listed above.

## Scenarios — Architecture Validation

Primary scenarios validate the 4+1 architecture: successful request flow through user-facing entrypoints, dependency failure propagation through process boundaries, data persistence and retrieval through storage boundaries, and deployment/change isolation through development-view package ownership. Each scenario traces back to the SYS coverage listed on ARCH rows.
