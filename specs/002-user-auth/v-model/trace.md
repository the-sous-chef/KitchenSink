## Orphan & Gap Report

### Orphan Analysis

**Orphan ATs** (acceptance tests with no corresponding REQ):

> None identified. All AT cases in `acceptance-plan.md` map to a REQ-\* identifier via the naming convention (AT-NNN-X → REQ-NNN).

**Orphan UTPs** (unit test cases with no corresponding MOD):

> None identified. All UTP cases in `unit-test.md` map to a MOD-NNN identifier.

**Orphan REQs** (requirements with no verification path):

> None identified. All 79 requirements have at least one verification method (Test, Inspection, or Analysis).

### Gap Analysis

**Requirements with no executable acceptance test (Inspection/Analysis only)**:

These requirements are verified by code review, static analysis, or architectural analysis — not by executable test scenarios. They are **not gaps** but are flagged for completeness:

**Integration test gaps**:

All 10 integration points identified in Matrix C lack defined integration test cases. Integration tests are required to verify cross-module contracts and are not covered by the current unit test plan or acceptance test plan.

**Recommendation**: Create an integration test plan (`integration-test.md`) covering the 10 integration points in Matrix C before implementation begins.
