# Implementation Plan: IdP User Authentication

**Branch**: `002-user-auth` | **Date**: 2026-05-13 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-user-auth/spec.md`
**Design reference**: [`docs/mockups/`](../../docs/mockups/) — HTML mockups + extracted design system (color, typography, spacing). Login/signup/MFA/session-expired/callback flows are rendered by **Clerk's hosted UI**; only app-rendered surfaces (profile, account, post-auth shell) have mockups under `docs/mockups/screens/`.

---

## Summary

This feature delivers IdP-based authentication and user lifecycle management for Commise web (Next.js) and mobile (Expo), with a locked split architecture:

- **Identity Service**: NestJS 11 on **AWS ECS/Fargate** (Node 24) exposing REST endpoints consumed by web/mobile
- **IdP Webhooks + Auth Pipeline**: raw **AWS Lambda** functions (Node 24.x, no NestJS) for:
    - identity.created webhook sync
    - async IdP deletion worker (SQS + DLQ)
    - nightly reconciliation
    - API Gateway REQUEST authorizer
- **Data storage**: **RDS PostgreSQL 16** (`db.t4g.micro`) using Drizzle ORM + `pg`
- **IaC**: unified CDK v2 (`aws-cdk-lib`) for all infrastructure — network/data/compute foundations, Lambda + API Gateway wiring (including REQUEST authorizer)

This preserves all functional scope in `spec.md` and `v-model/requirements.md`: signup sync, login/session, logout, profile, account edit, account deletion, password reset, social linking, suspension/reactivation, impersonation controls, and API authorization (REQ-001..REQ-050; FR-001..FR-044, excluding out-of-scope FR-035/FR-045).

---

## IdP tenant strategy

IdP tenancy is locked to new KitchenSink-owned tenants:

- `kitchensink-dev`
- `kitchensink-staging`
- `kitchensink-prod`

Rules:

1. **Do not reuse KitchenSink tenants**.
2. **Reuse existing IdP Actions/Triggers from tenant-template** (identity.created webhook and related trigger chain already configured).
3. **Do not author new IdP Actions** in this feature unless the source-of-truth spec is amended.
4. Environment-specific IdP credentials/domains are injected through secrets/config in infra.

Requirements impacted: REQ-001, REQ-004, REQ-005, REQ-013..REQ-017, REQ-027..REQ-031, REQ-041..REQ-044.

## Local development

Local integration test environment is locked to:

- **LocalStack Community**: SQS, S3, EventBridge/Scheduler emulation
- **PostgreSQL Docker container**: sibling service in same `docker-compose.yml` network
- **Identity Service (NestJS)**: runs locally via workspace dev target, connected to local Postgres
- **Lambdas**: invoked locally via CDK local tooling (`cdk-local`) against LocalStack endpoints

Planned local workflow:

1. `docker compose up` starts LocalStack + Postgres
2. Health checks verify LocalStack readiness and Postgres connectivity
3. Migrations/seed scripts initialize local DB state
4. `turbo run dev:local` starts identity service + local webhook/lambda workflow
5. E2E tests target local API Gateway/Lambda endpoints and local DB side effects

This is mandatory for REQ-049 (LocalStack-backed local testing) and supports REQ-013..REQ-017 and REQ-025..REQ-026 verification.

---

## Package-level responsibilities

### `packages/services/identity/src/types`

- **Types-only** boundary (no database dependencies, no Drizzle schemas, no DAOs)
- Owned by the identity service; canonical TypeScript types consumed by service, lambdas, and clients
- JWT claims, authorizer context, user/account/profile DTOs, admin actions, webhook payloads
- Exports: `@kitchensink/identity-service` (root), `@kitchensink/identity-service/types`
- Traceability: REQ-001..REQ-012, REQ-039..REQ-044, NFR-001, NFR-010

### `packages/services/identity/infra`

- CDK app: NetworkStack, DataStack, IdentityServiceStack, observability/secrets wiring; Lambda functions + API Gateway REST routes + REQUEST authorizer wiring
- No Terraform/Pulumi/SAM/raw CloudFormation templates
- Traceability: REQ-049, REQ-050, REQ-039..REQ-044

### `packages/services/identity-webhooks/`

- `authorizer` Lambda: JWT validation, claim extraction, suspension check, context injection
- `identity.created webhook` Lambda: idempotent UPSERT user/account/profile keyed by `sub` (no `app_metadata.userId` writeback)
- `deletion-worker` Lambda: retries IdP delete via SQS receive count/backoff and DLQ threshold
- `reconciliation` Lambda: periodic IdP-vs-DB diff and repair
- Traceability: REQ-013..REQ-017, REQ-025..REQ-026, REQ-039..REQ-044

### `packages/services/identity/`

- NestJS modules: `AuthModule`, `UsersModule`, `AccountsModule`, `ProfileModule`, `AdminModule`
- REST endpoints for profile/account/admin lifecycle
- Produces deletion jobs to SQS; consumes authorizer-injected identity context
- Traceability: REQ-018..REQ-038, FR-018..FR-037

---

## Security and reliability notes

- JWT verification via JWKS with in-process cache; enforce `iss`, `aud`, signature, expiration (REQ-039)
- Authorizer denies suspended users with `403` and injects `sub` context (REQ-040, REQ-042)
- Logout/revocation and secure token storage remain platform-specific per spec (REQ-006..REQ-012)
- Async deletion path must not block DB deletion completion; failed IdP deletions surface to DLQ/alarms (REQ-025, REQ-026)
- Reconciliation produces deterministic repair actions and audit logs (REQ-017, NFR-012..NFR-017)

---

## Specification Additions and Clarifications (post-creation)

The following were added to `spec.md` after the initial 2026-04-14 creation, via iterative `/speckit.clarify` and `/speckit.analyze` rounds. They are fully incorporated into `tasks.md` and must be respected during implementation.

### Webhook Payload Validation (FR-016a)

All webhook handlers MUST validate incoming payloads against a Zod schema at the entry point, before any business logic or database operations. Invalid payloads receive `400 Bad Request` (not 500), with sanitized logging and a CloudWatch metric for validation failures. This protects against IdP contract drift.

**Traceability**: FR-016a, T-072 (Zod schema definition), T-021/T-022/T-023 (handler entry points).

### Webhook Upsert Semantics (FR-017a)

`user.updated` (identity.updated) webhooks use upsert semantics: if the user exists, update; if not, create. `user.deleted` (identity.deleted) is idempotent no-op if the user is already soft-deleted. This ensures safe replay and out-of-order delivery.

**Traceability**: FR-017a, T-021 (webhook handler), T-023 (reconciliation).

### Performance Targets (NFR-011a)

Commise-controlled auth operations MUST meet:
- Silent token refresh endpoint ≤ 500ms P99
- Profile data endpoint ≤ 1s P99
- Webhook processing (API Gateway receipt → DB write) ≤ 2s P99

These targets apply only to Commise-controlled operations; IdP-hosted login page load times are out of scope.

**Traceability**: NFR-011a, T-083 (CI performance gates), T-087 (retry strategy).

### Capacity and Autoscaling Guidelines

**Day-one** (100 DAU, peak 10 req/s, 1 webhook/s):
- Single `db.t4g.micro` RDS
- 256MB Lambda
- 1 ECS task (`t4g.micro`)
- Monthly cost target ≤ $75

**Day-30** (500 DAU, peak 50 req/s, 5 webhooks/s): Trigger autoscaling at avg CPU > 70% for 10 min.

**Day-90** (1,500 DAU, peak 200 req/s, 20 webhooks/s):
- ECS → `t4g.medium`
- RDS → `db.t4g.small`
- Lambda → 512MB

All changes applied via CDK diff, never manual Console changes. Database migrations during low-traffic windows only.

**Traceability**: Spec Q15 (Round 4 clarification), T-013/T-014 (infra stacks).

### Data Retention Policy

- User PII (email, name, avatar URL): retained for lifetime of account + 30-day grace period after hard deletion
- After 30 days: permanently deleted
- Webhook event logs: retained 90 days then purged
- Identity IDs (`identity_id`): permanently retained (anonymized) for referential integrity

**Traceability**: Spec Q16 (Round 4 clarification), FR-022..FR-026 (deletion), NFR-012..NFR-013 (observability).

### Session Expiry UX

When session approaches expiry (5 minutes remaining):
1. Show warning banner with countdown
2. Save active form drafts to `localStorage`
3. On re-login after expiry, auto-restore drafts from `localStorage`
4. Clear `localStorage` drafts on successful re-auth

**Traceability**: NFR-016 (Round 3 clarification), T-051/T-052 (session management tasks).

## Requirement coverage map (high-level)

- **Auth flows + sessions**: REQ-001..REQ-012 (FR-001..FR-012)
- **Signup sync + reconciliation**: REQ-013..REQ-017 (FR-013..FR-017)
- **User/account/profile lifecycle**: REQ-018..REQ-026 (FR-018..FR-026)
- **Password/social**: REQ-027..REQ-034 (FR-027..FR-034)
- **Impersonation + authorization + suspension**: REQ-035..REQ-044 (FR-036..FR-044)
- **Cross-feature and infra constraints**: REQ-045..REQ-050 (NFR-001..NFR-017, NFR-011a)
- **Out of scope**: FR-045 (subscription tier from 001), FR-035 (MFA deprecated per Q4 Round 2)

---

## Constraints and non-goals

- No new IdP Actions authored in this feature (reuse existing tenant-template Actions/Triggers)
- No Aurora DSQL references or implementation
- No Terraform/Pulumi/SAM adoption
- No external IaC repository dependencies
- No changes to source-of-truth requirements documents in this rewrite
- No admin dashboard UI (suspension/reactivation/impersonation are backend/API operations only)
- No MFA enrollment (out of scope per spec.md Q4 Round 2 clarification)

## Implementation Drift (Auth0 → Clerk migration status)

The feature was originally specified against Auth0 and migrated to Clerk mid-implementation. This section records the migration state as of branch rename to `002-user-auth`.

### Doc layer — fully migrated
- All 11 substantive docs under `specs/002-user-auth/` (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, `tasks.md`, full `v-model/`, `checklists/`, `product-spec/`, `contracts/`) reference Clerk only.
- `research.md` and `findings.md` retain a single Auth0 mention each as explicit migration history — preserved intentionally.

### Production code — fully migrated
- Zero `@auth0/*` or `react-native-auth0` npm dependencies remain.
- Installed Clerk SDKs: `@clerk/nextjs ^6.39` (web), `@clerk/expo ^2.4` (mobile), `@clerk/backend ^1.27` (webhooks).
- Web app routes/middleware/components use Clerk (`ClerkProvider`, `clerkMiddleware`, `auth()`, `currentUser()`, `<SignIn>`, `<SignUp>`, `<UserButton>`).
- Mobile app uses `@clerk/expo` with `expo-secure-store` token cache.
- Webhooks verify Svix-signed Clerk events (`user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`) via `@clerk/backend`.
- Identity service domain model renamed `auth0Id` → `clerkId` (commit `13808a8`).
- Stale Auth0 env vars removed (commit `3ab8212`).
- Infra stack tests assert absence of any `auth0` string in synthesized templates (anti-drift sentinels).

### Remaining drift (none)
The two stub e2e tests that previously held Auth0-shaped fixtures
(`deletion-worker-e2e.test.ts`, `local-api-e2e.test.ts` under
`packages/services/identity/tests/e2e/`) were removed during the Clerk
migration. Proper e2e coverage now lives in
`packages/services/identity-webhooks/tests/e2e/auth/` (16 tests across
`api.spec.ts` and `deletion.spec.ts`) and runs via `npm run test:e2e`.

### Naming history
- Branch `002-auth0-user-auth` was renamed to `002-user-auth` during this migration.
- Worktree directory moved from `.worktrees/002-auth0-user-auth/` to `.worktrees/002-user-auth/`.
- Spec directory `specs/002-auth0-user-auth/` was renamed to `specs/002-user-auth/` on the feature branch (commit `dba0863`); the old path may still exist on `main` until merge.

## Requirement Traceability Addendum (sync-verify Group D, 2026-06-02)

Added in response to sync-verify Run #1 Layer-3 findings (DRIFT-002..DRIFT-024). Maps each Functional Requirement in `spec.md` to its primary plan-level home. Where an FR is satisfied by an existing decision row, package responsibility, or specification addition above, the row identifies it. FRs whose implementation work is fully described in `tasks.md` (and not separately discussed in plan.md) cite the relevant task IDs as their plan-level locus.

| FR-027..FR-028 | Password reset via IdP-hosted flow (no app-side password handling) | Decision `Authorizer model` (IdP-managed); no app task — provided by Clerk hosted UI |

**Out-of-scope FRs**: FR-029..FR-031 (MFA enrollment — see spec.md §Out of Scope). FR-032..FR-037 (social linking, operator impersonation) deferred to P2 — tracked in tasks.md US-009, US-012 but not exercised in v1 plan.
