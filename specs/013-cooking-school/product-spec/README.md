## Traceability Rules Applied

1. Live classes are explicitly out of v1 scope; async video is the launch boundary.
2. Purchase and revenue mechanics depend on feature 010; creator identity and follow surfaces depend on feature 012.
3. Metrics are product validation targets and do not imply implementation or executed test evidence.
4. Wireframes are explicitly absent and should be generated before visual implementation work begins.
