# Product Specification: Cooking School (Video Learning Platform)

**Feature**: `013-cooking-school`
**Version**: 0.1 (bootstrapped)
**Date**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: Awaiting revalidation

---

## Executive Summary

013-cooking-school is a two-sided video learning marketplace embedded in KitchenSink. Educators publish structured cooking courses; learners discover, purchase, and track progress through them. It is the largest of the 011/012/013 expansion by scope, requiring new video infrastructure, a two-sided monetization model, and integration with four existing features (002, 005, 010, 012).

Live classes are Phase 2. v1 ships async video only.

## Personas

### Co-Primary

**P12 Jamie** (learner): Home cook who wants structured instruction beyond recipe cards. Motivated by skill improvement, not just meal output. Willing to pay for quality content from trusted educators. Frustrated by YouTube's lack of structure and MasterClass's price point. (canonical persona — see `specs/cross-feature-consistency-report.md` §9 Canonical Persona Library)

**P13 Reese** (educator): Recipe creator who wants to monetize her expertise through video. Already has an audience via her `CreatorProfile` (012). Needs a low-friction upload workflow and transparent revenue reporting. The AI script drafting feature (005) is her highest-value "Should" story. (canonical persona — see `specs/cross-feature-consistency-report.md` §9 Canonical Persona Library)

### Secondary

**P1 Casey**: Everyday home cook. Uses lessons to solve specific problems ("how do I debone a chicken?"). Likely to buy individual courses rather than follow a single educator.

**P2 Taylor**: Follows specific educators. Wants to know when Reese publishes something new. The follow/feed integration with 012 is important for Taylor's discovery loop.

### Tertiary

**P9 Drew**: Professional chef or culinary school instructor. High-production courses, multiple lessons per course, expects pro-tier revenue share. Drew's presence validates the platform's quality ceiling.

## User Journey

### Learner Journey (P12 Jamie)

1. **Discovery**: Jamie sees a course card on Reese's `@handle` profile page (012) or in a feed recommendation.
2. **Preview**: Jamie watches the first lesson for free. No account required to preview; purchase requires auth (002).
3. **Purchase**: Jamie completes checkout via 010 billing. Enrollment is immediate.
4. **Learning**: Jamie works through lessons at her own pace. Progress auto-saves at 80% watch completion.
5. **Completion**: Jamie marks the course complete. No certificate in v1; completion is visible in her progress dashboard.

### Educator Journey (P13 Reese)

1. **Setup**: Reese's educator account is her existing `CreatorProfile` (012) with an educator flag enabled via 010 subscription tier.
2. **Course creation**: Reese creates a course, sets a price, and adds lessons one by one.
3. **Upload**: Reese uploads a video. The platform transcodes it to HLS via MediaConvert and delivers via CloudFront.
4. **AI assist**: Reese links a recipe to a lesson and requests an AI script draft (005). She edits the draft and records her video.
5. **Publish**: Reese publishes the course. It appears on her profile and in discovery surfaces.
6. **Revenue**: Reese sees enrollment count and revenue in her educator dashboard. Payouts follow 010's disbursement schedule.

## Internal Stakeholders

Internal/operational roles — not user personas. See `specs/cross-feature-consistency-report.md` §9 for the distinction.

## Cross-Feature Integration Points

### 010 — Subscriptions & Monetization

Course purchases are one-time charges processed through 010's Stripe integration. A new `course_purchase` product type is registered with 010. Educator subscription tier (free vs. pro) is read from 010 to determine revenue share rate and upload limits. Payout disbursement follows 010's existing schedule.

### 005 — AI Integration

The `/api/v1/lessons/:id/draft-script` endpoint calls the 005 AI service with the linked recipe entity and a lesson-specific prompt template. The 005 service is not modified; 013 adds a new prompt template only.

### 012 — Creator Profiles

`CreatorProfile` is owned by 012. 013 reads `creator_profile_id` to associate courses with an educator. Course listings appear on the educator's `@handle` profile page via a 012 extension point. 013 does not write to `CreatorProfile`.

### 002 — Auth

All educator and learner actions require a valid JWT (002). Educator role is a claim on the token, gated by 010 subscription tier. Enrollment access checks are enforced in the 013 lesson access guard.

### 001 — Recipe Entity

Lessons hold an optional `recipe_id` FK. The recipe entity is read-only from 013's perspective; it provides source material for AI script drafting and the in-player recipe drawer.

## Open Questions for Revalidation

1. À la carte lesson purchases in v1 or v2?
2. Minimum viable educator analytics: views only, or views + revenue breakdown?
3. Mobile video upload (phone camera) in v1, or web-only?
4. AI script drafting from public recipes the educator doesn't own — allowed or restricted to owned recipes?
5. Should the free preview lesson be configurable per course, or always the first lesson?
