# Architecture Design: Cooking School (Video Learning Platform)

**Feature Branch**: `013-cooking-school`
**Created**: 2026-05-10
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/013-cooking-school/v-model/system-design.md`

## Overview

Architecture decomposition maps each system component into module-boundary units optimized for integration verification and implementation traceability. Interfaces are explicit for auth, billing, media, policy, and governance concerns.

## ID Schema

- **Architecture Module**: `ARCH-NNN`
- **Parent System Components**: comma-separated `SYS-NNN` list
