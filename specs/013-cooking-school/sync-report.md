## Executive Summary

| Item          | Count |
| ------------- | ----- |
| CRITICAL      | 3     |
| WARNING       | 3     |
| PASSED        | 4     |
| INFO          | 3     |
| SKIPPED (L5)  | 1     |

**Overall Status:** **CRITICAL** — Pre-implementation; all findings are artifact/traceability gaps reflecting an unstarted implementation, not regressions.

## Layer Results

### L1 — Research → Product Spec (PASSED)

| Check | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `research.md` present and readable | ✅ |
| `product-spec/product-spec.md` present and readable | ✅ |
| Key recommendations (async video v1, live Phase 2) reflected across artifacts | ✅ |

### L2 — Product Spec → Spec (PASSED)

| Check | Status | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Personas aligned (P12, P13, P1, P2, P9) | ✅ | Both artifacts list all 5 personas |
| Must Have story set coverage | ✅ | `spec.md`: US-001..US-005; `product-spec`: FR-001..FR-010 |
| No missing Must Have requirements | ✅ | 10/10 FRs accounted for at story level |

| Caveat | Severity |
| --- | --- |
| `spec.md` uses user stories; `product-spec` uses FR IDs. No explicit crosswalk section in `spec.md`. | ⚠️ WARNING |

### L3 — Spec → Plan (PASSED)

| Check | Status | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All Must Have USs decomposed into plan acceptance criteria | ✅ | US-001..US-005 mapped in plan.md §Functional Acceptance |
| Governance rules referenced | ✅ | GR-002, GR-007, GR-012, GR-014 |
| Cross-feature dependencies mapped | ✅ | 002, 005, 010, 012 explicitly in Dependencies table |

### L4 — Plan → Tasks (CRITICAL)

| Check | Status | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task coverage exists for all Must Have US/FRs | ✅ | T024-T052 cover authoring, ingest, enrollment, progress |
| Tasks checked vs unchecked | ❌ CRITICAL | **0/85** checked; 0 execution evidence |
| Implementation workspaces exist | ❌ CRITICAL | 0 files found for `packages/api/cooking-school-*`, `packages/shared/cooking-school-*`, `packages/apps/sous-chef/{web,mobile}` feature areas |

**Evidence:**
- `tasks.md` contains 85 tasks (T001-T085 with gaps) — all unchecked.
- Glob searches across monorepo returned zero files for planned workspaces.

### L5 — Tasks → Code (SKIPPED)

> Skipped per instruction.

### L6 — Code → Verify (INFO)

| Check | Status | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Implementation code exists | ℹ️ | 0 feature files — expected pre-impl |
| `verify-report.md` exists | ✅ | Contains valid multi-layer analysis |
| `v-model/release-audit-report.md` | ℹ️ | BLOCKED (102 untested scenarios) — expected pre-impl |

### L7 — Cross-Feature Dependency Evidence (CRITICAL)

| Dependency | Relationship | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 002-user-auth | Required in spec.md | ❌ CRITICAL | No integration test or contract evidence |
| 010-subscriptions | Referenced (billing, payouts) | ❌ CRITICAL | No execution evidence of revenue-share/purchase flow |
| 012-creator-profile | Referenced (educator identity) | ❌ CRITICAL | No contract integration evidence |
| 005-ai-integration | Referenced (script drafting) | ⚠️ WARNING | No execution evidence |
| 001-sous-chef-recipe-app | Referenced (recipe-linked lessons) | ⚠️ WARNING | No execution evidence |

| Check | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Monorepo workspace refs outside `packages/apps/sous-chef/{web,mobile}` | ℹ️ INFO — none found |
| `apps/X` refs flagged INFO | ℹ️ INFO — none found |

## Critical Findings Detail

### CR-001 (L4): Pre-Implementation Task Coverage — No Execution Evidence

- **Finding:** `tasks.md` defines 85 tasks spanning the full plan decomposition. All remain unchecked.
- **Impact:** The L4 → L5 closure point cannot be satisfied until tasks are executed and checked.
- **Fix path:** Execute tasks and ingest evidence into `verify-report.md` / `.forge-status.yml`.

### CR-002 (L4): No Implementation Code Found

- **Finding:** Zero feature-level code files found in planned monorepo workspaces.
- **Impact:** L4 cannot show forward traceability to code artifacts.
- **Fix path:** Scaffold `packages/api/cooking-school-api`, `packages/shared/cooking-school-contracts`, and relevant web/mobile feature directories per `plan.md` §Scope Baseline.

### CR-003 (L7): Required Cross-Feature Integration Evidence Missing

- **Finding:** `spec.md` lists 002 as Required; 010 and 012 as Referenced. No integration contract tests, snapshots, or executed runs exist in the 013 feature directory or monorepo.
- **Impact:** M7 exit criteria require demonstrable end-to-end flows (educator publish → learner purchase → entitlement) gated by 010 + authenticated by 002.
- **Fix path:** Implement integration task chains (T074, T075) and produce contract test artifacts.

---

## Warning Findings Detail

### WR-001 (L2): FR ID Absence in spec.md

- `spec.md` expresses requirements as US-NNN user stories. `product-spec/product-spec.md` enumerates FR-001..FR-020. No explicit FR-to-US mapping exists in `spec.md`.
- **Fix path:** Add FR crosswalk table or inline FR IDs in `spec.md` user story section.

### WR-002 (L7): Referenced Dependency Integration Evidence

- 005-ai-integration and 001-sous-chef-recipe-app are referenced but have no contract integration evidence.
- **Fix path:** Add integration contract tests for AI draft (T055) and recipe link (T032) once implementation begins.

### WR-003 (L7): Forge Lifecycle State Drift

- `.forge-status.yml` marks `plan`/`tasks` as completed while `implement` is `not-started` and `verify` is `failed`.
- **Fix path:** Reconcile `.forge-status.yml` after each completed phase; update states at pre-impl, post-impl, and post-verify gates.

---

## Info Findings Detail

- **IF-001:** `v-model/release-audit-report.md` blocked (102 untested) is expected pre-implementation.
- **IF-002:** `verify-report.md` already contains valid multi-layer analysis (was run Phase 7).
- **IF-003:** No monorepo workspace refs flagged outside `packages/apps/sous-chef/{web,mobile}`.
