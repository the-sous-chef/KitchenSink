## Layer 1: Code ↔ Tasks

| Check                                   | Status | Finding                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All tasks have verifiable code          | ❌     | `tasks.md` contains 69 tasks (`T001`-`T085` with gaps), but no implementation workspaces/files were found for planned targets (no `packages/api/cooking-school-*`, no `packages/shared/cooking-school-*`). |
| No unchecked tasks                      | ❌     | `tasks.md` has `0` checked and `69` unchecked tasks.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Task count matches implementation scope | ❌     | Planned implementation scope is non-trivial (API, shared contracts, ingest, enrollment, analytics), but observable implementation scope is `0` feature code files.                                         |

`CODE_TASKS_COVERAGE`: **0/69 (0.0%)** tasks with verifiable implementation evidence.

## Layer 2: Code ↔ Plan

| Planned Component                                                           | Implemented | Notes                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature 013 API/workspace deliverables in `plan.md` + `tasks.md`            | ❌          | No corresponding feature implementation directories found in `packages/api/` or `packages/shared/`. |
| M7 end-to-end demo path (educator publish + learner purchase/enroll/access) | ❌          | `plan.md` defines this as exit evidence; no code or test execution evidence exists yet.             |
| Verification artifact requirement (`verify-report.md`)                      | ✅          | This report now exists.                                                                             |

## Layer 5: Research Alignment

| Recommendation                                 | Followed | Notes                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Async video v1, live classes Phase 2           | ✅       | Consistently reflected in `research.md`, `product-spec/product-spec.md`, and `spec.md`. |
| Preview-first conversion pattern               | ✅       | Captured in user stories + tasks; implementation evidence pending.                      |
| 80% completion threshold for lesson completion | ✅       | Present in `research.md`/`product-spec`; planned through tasks; not yet implemented.    |
| Recipe-linked learning + AI draft assist       | ✅       | Present across research/spec/product-spec/plan/tasks; implementation pending.           |
| Subscription/entitlement gating integration    | ✅       | Present in plan/tasks and governance mapping; implementation pending.                   |

Advisory result: strategic alignment is strong at artifact level; runtime adherence cannot yet be verified.

## Layer 6: Document Integrity

| Check                                                                                  | Status |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| All local markdown links under `specs/013-cooking-school/*.md` resolve                 | ✅     |
| `product-spec/product-spec.md` references are valid                                    | ✅     |
| Feature artifact cross-links (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `review.md`) are valid | ✅     |

## CRITICAL Findings

### CRITICAL-001

- **Layer:** Code ↔ Tasks
- **Finding:** `tasks.md` defines 69 implementation tasks, with no verifiable feature implementation code.
- **Impact:** Full traceability chain cannot be closed at implementation layer.
- **Evidence:** `specs/013-cooking-school/tasks.md`; absence of `packages/api/cooking-school-*` and `packages/shared/cooking-school-*`.
- **Suggested fix:** Execute implementation tasks and create planned workspaces/modules before re-running verify-full.

### CRITICAL-002

- **Layer:** Code ↔ Tasks
- **Finding:** All 69 tasks remain unchecked.
- **Impact:** No execution evidence exists that planned work was completed.
- **Evidence:** `specs/013-cooking-school/tasks.md` task checkbox state (`0/69` checked).
- **Suggested fix:** Complete tasks incrementally, check them off with linked code/test evidence.

### CRITICAL-003

- **Layer:** Code ↔ Plan
- **Finding:** Planned technical scope (authoring API, media ingest/transcode, enrollment, progress, analytics, compliance) is unimplemented.
- **Impact:** M7 feature-level exit criteria cannot be satisfied.
- **Evidence:** `specs/013-cooking-school/plan.md`; no matching implementation packages/files.
- **Suggested fix:** Implement plan-defined modules, then validate with integration/system tests.

### CRITICAL-004

- **Layer:** V-model execution evidence
- **Finding:** Release audit remains blocked due to unexecuted scenarios.
- **Impact:** Feature cannot pass release gate.
- **Evidence:** `specs/013-cooking-school/v-model/release-audit-report.md` compliance status (`❌ BLOCKED — 102 test scenarios untested`). Traceability mapping gaps are resolved; no scenario execution results have been ingested.
- **Suggested fix:** Execute mapped V-Model scenarios and ingest real test execution results/waivers.

### CRITICAL-005

- **Layer:** Milestone exit readiness (M7)
- **Finding:** Required verify state (`0 CRITICAL, 0 WARNING`) is not met.
- **Impact:** 013 cannot be marked complete for M7.
- **Evidence:** `specs/013-cooking-school/plan.md` M7 exit criteria vs current verification counts.
- **Suggested fix:** Resolve all CRITICAL/WARNING findings and rerun `/speckit.product-forge.verify-full`.

---

## WARNING Findings

### WARNING-001

- **Layer:** spec.md ↔ product-spec.md
- **Finding:** `product-spec/product-spec.md` enumerates `FR-001..FR-020`, while `spec.md` contains user stories but no explicit FR-ID mapping.
- **Suggested action:** Add deterministic FR mapping in `spec.md` (or explicit crosswalk section) to reduce drift risk.

### WARNING-002

- **Layer:** User Stories ↔ Implementation
- **Finding:** Must-have stories are decomposed into tasks but have no test-backed implementation evidence.
- **Suggested action:** Implement story slices with linked test cases and update verification evidence.

### WARNING-003

- **Layer:** .forge-status lifecycle state
- **Finding:** `.forge-status.yml` still marks `plan`/`tasks` as `not-started` despite existing artifacts.
- **Suggested action:** Reconcile lifecycle state metadata after artifact generation and after each completed phase.

### WARNING-004

- **Layer:** Cross-feature dependency evidence
- **Finding:** Dependency contracts with 002/010/012/005 are planned but not proven by integration execution evidence.
- **Suggested action:** Add integration test runs/artifacts showing contract-level verification across feature boundaries.

### WARNING-005

- **Layer:** Traceability completeness
- **Finding:** Matrix/plan/tasks alignment exists at document level but not at executed code/test level.
- **Suggested action:** Promote document traceability to runtime traceability (code paths + test IDs + CI evidence).

---

## PASSED Findings

### PASSED-001

- **Layer:** Artifact inventory completeness
- **Finding:** Feature directory contains core verification chain artifacts (`research.md`, `product-spec/product-spec.md`, `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `review.md`, `.forge-status.yml`, `v-model/*`).

### PASSED-002

- **Layer:** Story-level scope consistency
- **Finding:** Story set (`US-001..US-009`) is consistently represented and phased; live classes are explicitly deferred.

### PASSED-003

- **Layer:** Out-of-scope control
- **Finding:** No evidence of v1 scope creep into Phase 2 live-class functionality.

### PASSED-004

- **Layer:** Governance intent alignment
- **Finding:** Plan/tasks/review consistently map to governance controls (API prefix, shared type ownership, subscription gating, audience model).

### PASSED-005

- **Layer:** Research-to-product/spec narrative continuity
- **Finding:** Core recommendations (preview gate, progress semantics, recipe/AI linkage, creator identity integration) remain aligned across artifacts.

### PASSED-006

- **Layer:** Link integrity
- **Finding:** Local markdown link validation across feature artifacts reports no broken references.

### PASSED-007

- **Layer:** Verify artifact generation requirement
- **Finding:** `verify-report.md` now exists at the required path for Feature 013.

---

## SKIPPED Checks

### SKIPPED-001

- **Layer:** User story acceptance criteria verification from runtime behavior
- **Reason:** No implementation code/test execution evidence to validate behavior.

### SKIPPED-002

- **Layer:** Should-have cross-feature UX outcomes (feed/follow and payout breakdown behavior)
- **Reason:** Depends on integrated runtime implementations across 010/012 not yet delivered here.

### SKIPPED-003

- **Layer:** NFR-to-code verification
- **Reason:** NFRs are not represented as deterministic NFR-ID sets in both source artifacts for strict ID crosswalk.

## Conclusion

**FAIL**: Full traceability from research → product spec → spec → plan → tasks exists at documentation level, but the implementation/test execution layer is not yet present. `5` CRITICAL issues must be resolved before Feature 013 can pass Phase 7 verification.
