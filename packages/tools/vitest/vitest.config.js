/**
 * Base Vitest configuration for KitchenSink packages.
 *
 * Provides a shared test configuration that:
 * - globals: true -- Makes describe, it, expect, and other test globals available without imports.
 * - include pattern -- Discovers test files in __tests__ directories with .test.ts or .test.tsx suffix.
 * - exclude -- Skips scanning node_modules and dist directories.
 * - resolve.alias -- Maps the `@` path alias to `./src` relative to the consuming workspace root.
 *
 * Consumers should merge this config with their own using mergeConfig() from vitest/config
 * to extend or override specific test options.
 *
 * Tests should be located in __tests__ folders following the KitchenSink file organization pattern.
